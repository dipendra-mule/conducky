## Current Role System Documentation

### Role Hierarchy (Documented)

1. **System Scope**
   - `system_admin`: Global administrative access

2. **Organization Scope**  
   - `org_admin`: Full control within organization
   - `org_viewer`: Read-only organization access

3. **Event Scope**
   - `event_admin`: Full control within event
   - `responder`: Incident response capabilities
   - `reporter`: Incident submission capabilities

### Role Inheritance (Documented)

- System Admins have system-wide access but need explicit roles for data access
- Organization Admins inherit event admin permissions for their organization's events
- Organization Viewers have read-only access to their organization's events
- Event roles are specific unless inherited from organization level

### Permission Matrix (Documented)

Comprehensive permission tables showing what each role can do at each scope level, including:
- System-level operations (creating organizations, system settings)
- Organization-level operations (creating events, managing members)
- Event-level operations (managing incidents, assigning roles)

## Testing Documentation Added

### RBAC Testing Categories

1. **Unit Tests**: Direct testing of UnifiedRBACService methods
2. **Integration Tests**: Middleware and API endpoint testing
3. **Security Tests**: Data isolation and permission enforcement
4. **Performance Tests**: Caching and optimization verification

### Test Examples Provided

- Role inheritance testing scenarios
- Cross-scope permission verification
- Data isolation validation
- Cache performance testing
- Manual testing checklists

## Security Considerations Documented

### Access Control
- All API endpoints enforce role-based permissions
- UI elements hidden based on user permissions
- Database queries automatically scoped by permissions

### Data Privacy
- Event data strictly isolated between organizations
- Reporter information protected by role permissions
- Internal comments isolated from reporters

### Audit Logging
- All role assignments logged
- Permission checks monitored
- Failed access attempts tracked

## Development Guidelines Updated

### Architecture Principles
- Mobile-first design requirements
- Multi-tenancy with data isolation
- Unified RBAC enforcement at all levels
- Security-first development approach

### Code Standards
- TypeScript strict mode requirements
- JSDoc comment requirements for public APIs
- Testing requirements for all new features
- Security review processes

### Workflow Standards
- Feature branch workflow with testing requirements
- Pull request requirements and review process
- Documentation update requirements
- Security consideration documentation

## Files Not Modified

The following files were **intentionally not modified** as they are auto-generated:
- `/website/docs/api/**` - Auto-generated from OpenAPI specs
- Database migration files
- Generated TypeScript types

## Validation Performed

### Documentation Accuracy
- Cross-referenced with actual Prisma schema
- Verified against backend implementation code
- Checked role definitions in UnifiedRBACService
- Validated permission checking logic

### Consistency Checks
- Role naming consistent across all documentation
- Permission descriptions match implementation
- API documentation aligns with actual endpoints
- Testing procedures reflect current system

### Completeness Review
- All major role scenarios documented
- Permission edge cases covered
- Security considerations addressed
- Testing strategies comprehensive

## Recommendations for Ongoing Maintenance

### Documentation Updates
1. Update documentation when adding new roles or permissions
2. Maintain JSDoc comments when changing API methods
3. Update testing documentation when adding new test categories
4. Review permission matrices when changing inheritance rules

### Validation Procedures
1. Run documentation build to check for errors
2. Verify API documentation generation from updated JSDoc
3. Test documented procedures against actual system
4. Review cross-references when moving or renaming files

### Quality Assurance
1. Regular documentation audits for accuracy
2. User feedback collection on documentation clarity
3. Developer feedback on contributing guide effectiveness
4. Security review of documented procedures

## Migration Notes

**Important**: This documentation update reflects the current live system. No migration documentation was added since the unified RBAC system is the current implementation, not a migration target.

The documentation now accurately reflects:
- Current role system in production
- Actual permission inheritance behavior
- Live API endpoints and their requirements
- Current testing procedures and requirements

---

This update ensures that all documentation accurately reflects Conducky's current implementation and provides comprehensive guidance for users, administrators, and developers working with the system.
