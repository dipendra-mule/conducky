# Testing Implementation Plan

A step-by-step checklist for implementing robust, automated testing for the project. Check off each item as you complete it.

---

## Backend (Node.js/Express/Prisma)

- [X] Add Jest and supertest as dev dependencies
- [X] Create `backend/tests/` directory
- [ ] Add sample unit test for `utils/rbac.js`
- [ ] Add sample integration test for `/audit-test` endpoint
- [ ] Configure Jest for coverage reporting
- [ ] Add `test` and `test:coverage` scripts to `backend/package.json`
- [ ] Document backend test setup and running in `/docs/testing.md`

---

## Frontend (Next.js/React)

- [ ] Add Jest and React Testing Library as dev dependencies
- [ ] Create `frontend/__tests__/` directory (or colocate tests with components)
- [ ] Add sample test for `Button.js` component
- [ ] Add sample test for `login.js` page
- [ ] Configure Jest for coverage reporting
- [ ] Add `test` and `test:coverage` scripts to `frontend/package.json`
- [ ] Document frontend test setup and running in `/docs/testing.md`

---

## Documentation

- [ ] Create `/docs/testing.md` with:
  - [ ] How to run backend and frontend tests (with and without Docker Compose)
  - [ ] How to write new tests
  - [ ] How to interpret coverage reports

---

## Local Automation

- [ ] Add a root-level script or Makefile to run both backend and frontend tests
- [ ] Document how to run all tests together
- [ ] Document how to run tests in Docker Compose

---

## CI/CD (Future)

- [ ] Plan and document a GitHub Actions workflow to run all tests on PRs
- [ ] Add coverage badge/reporting to README (optional)
