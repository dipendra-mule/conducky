# Role Definitions

This page provides detailed information about each role in Conducky's RBAC system, including their capabilities, limitations, and data access permissions.

## 🔐 System Level Roles

### System Admin (`system_admin`)

**Primary Purpose**: Overall platform administration and system oversight

**Capabilities:**
- Create and manage organizations
- Create events across all organizations
- Access system-wide settings and monitoring
- Generate admin invite links for any event
- View system audit logs and analytics
- Manage global system settings

**Data Access:**
- No automatic access to event incident data
- Must be explicitly assigned event roles to view incidents
- Can view system-level statistics and health metrics
- Access to organization metadata (but not event details)

**Important Limitation:**
System Admins follow the principle of least privilege - they cannot access event incident data without explicit event-level permissions. This ensures that system maintenance doesn't compromise event data privacy.

## 🔄 Role Inheritance Rules

### Within Event Scope
- **Event Admin** inherits all **Responder** permissions
- **Responder** inherits all **Reporter** permissions

### Within Organization Scope  
- **Organization Admin** automatically gets **Event Admin** role for all organization events
- **Organization Viewer** gets no automatic event permissions

### Cross-Scope Rules
- **System Admin** does NOT automatically inherit organization or event permissions
- Roles must be explicitly assigned at each scope level
- Higher system roles cannot bypass event-level privacy controls

## 🎭 Role Assignment Examples

### Conference Organizer Workflow
1. **System Admin** creates organization and assigns **Organization Admin** role
2. **Organization Admin** creates events and becomes **Event Admin** automatically
3. **Event Admin** invites response team as **Responders**
4. **Responders** can access all incident data for their events

### Multi-Event User
A user might have:
- **Responder** role for "DevConf 2024"
- **Event Admin** role for "Security Summit 2024"  
- **Reporter** role for "Open Source Days 2024"

Each role grants different permissions within its specific event scope.
