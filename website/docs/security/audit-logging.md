# Audit Logging and System Monitoring

Conducky maintains comprehensive audit logs to track all significant actions within the system. This provides accountability, security monitoring, and compliance support for incident management operations.

## Audit System Overview

### Purpose and Benefits
- **Accountability**: Track who performed what actions and when
- **Security Monitoring**: Detect unauthorized access or suspicious activity
- **Compliance**: Support regulatory requirements and internal policies
- **Incident Investigation**: Provide detailed history for incident resolution
- **System Debugging**: Help troubleshoot issues with detailed action history

### Audit Log Structure
Each audit log entry contains:
- **Action**: What was performed (e.g., "create_incident", "assign_user")
- **Target Type**: Type of entity affected (e.g., "incident", "user", "event")
- **Target ID**: Unique identifier of the affected entity
- **User ID**: Who performed the action (null for system actions)
- **Timestamp**: When the action occurred
- **Event/Organization Context**: Scope of the action for multi-tenancy
- **IP Address**: Source IP of the request (when available)
- **User Agent**: Browser/client information (when available)

## Audit Log Access and Viewing

### Access Control
Audit log access is strictly controlled based on user roles:

#### Event-Level Audit Logs
- **Event Admins**: Can view all audit logs for their events
- **Responders**: Can view audit logs for incidents they're involved with
- **Reporters**: Cannot access audit logs directly

#### Organization-Level Audit Logs
- **Organization Admins**: Can view all audit logs for their organization and its events
- **Organization Viewers**: Can view limited audit logs (non-sensitive actions)

#### System-Level Audit Logs
- **System Admins**: Can view all audit logs across the entire system
- **Regular Users**: Cannot access system-level audit logs

### Audit Log Viewing Interfaces

#### Web Interface
- **Event Audit Page**: `/events/{eventSlug}/audit`
- **Organization Audit Page**: `/orgs/{orgSlug}/audit`
- **System Audit Page**: `/admin/system/audit`

#### API Endpoints
- **Event Audit API**: `GET /api/audit/events/{eventId}/audit`
- **Organization Audit API**: `GET /api/audit/organizations/{organizationId}/audit`
- **System Audit API**: `GET /api/audit/system/audit`

### Filtering and Search
All audit log interfaces support:
- **Time Range Filtering**: Filter by date/time ranges
- **Action Type Filtering**: Filter by specific action types
- **User Filtering**: Filter by specific users
- **Target Type Filtering**: Filter by entity types (incident, user, etc.)
- **Text Search**: Search within action descriptions
- **Sorting**: Sort by timestamp, action, user, or target type

## Audit Log Implementation

### Automatic Logging
Audit logging is integrated into the service layer:

    A[User Action] --> B[Service Method]
    B --> C[Business Logic]
    C --> D[Database Update]
    D --> E[Audit Log Entry]
    E --> F[Response to User]
    
    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style E fill:#fff3e0
    style F fill:#e8f5e9
```

### Audit Log Storage
- **Database Table**: `AuditLog` table in PostgreSQL
- **Encryption**: Audit logs are encrypted at rest

### Performance Considerations
- **Asynchronous Logging**: Audit logs are written asynchronously to avoid performance impact
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple audit entries can be batched for efficiency
- **Indexing**: Database indexes optimize audit log queries
- **Pagination**: Large audit log results are paginated

## Security and Compliance

### Audit Log Security
- **Immutable Records**: Audit logs cannot be modified after creation
- **Integrity Verification**: Checksums ensure audit log integrity
- **Access Monitoring**: Access to audit logs is itself audited
- **Encryption**: All audit data is encrypted at rest and in transit

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Audit Log Monitoring
- **Failed Audit Writes**: Alert when audit logging fails
- **Suspicious Patterns**: Detect unusual access patterns
- **Privilege Escalation**: Monitor for unauthorized role changes
- **Data Access Anomalies**: Unusual data access patterns

### Security Alerts
- **Multiple Failed Logins**: Potential brute force attacks
- **Privilege Changes**: Unauthorized role modifications
- **Mass Data Access**: Bulk data downloads or access
- **After-Hours Activity**: Unusual activity outside business hours

### Dashboard Metrics
- **Audit Volume**: Number of audit events over time
- **User Activity**: Most active users and action types
- **Error Rates**: Failed actions and error patterns
- **Compliance Status**: Current compliance posture
