# Admin Guide

Welcome to the Conducky Admin Guide!

This section is for **system administrators** and **System Admins** who are responsible for installing, deploying, and managing the overall Conducky system. If you're setting up Conducky for your organization or managing the technical infrastructure at the system level, this guide is for you.

## What's Covered

- **Installation & Deployment** - How to set up Conducky in various environments
- **System Configuration** - Environment variables, database setup, and system settings
- **System Admin Functions** - Creating events and managing global system settings
- **System Maintenance** - Updates, backups, and ongoing system maintenance
- **Troubleshooting** - System-level issues and solutions

## Who This Guide Is For

- System administrators setting up Conducky
- DevOps engineers deploying Conducky
- IT staff managing Conducky instances
- System Admins who create and manage events at the system level
- Anyone responsible for the technical operation of the overall Conducky system

## Not What You're Looking For?

- **Event administrators, responders, and attendees** (people using Conducky within events) should see the [User Guide](../user-guide/intro).
- **Developers** (people contributing code to Conducky) should see the [Developer Docs](../developer-docs/intro).

## SystemAdmin vs Org Admin/Event Admin

- **SystemAdmin**: Can create events, has system-wide access, manages the overall Conducky instance
