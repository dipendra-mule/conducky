# Organization Management

Organizations provide a powerful way to group related events under a single administrative umbrella. As a System Admin, you have the ability to create, manage, and oversee all organizations in the system.

## Overview

Organizations in Conducky allow for:

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Group related events under organizations
- **Distributed Administration**: Delegate event management to organization admins
- **Centralized Oversight**: Maintain system-wide visibility while enabling autonomous operation
- **Scalable Management**: Support multiple organizations with different governance structures

## Organization Creation

### Creating Organizations

Only System Admins can create new organizations:

1. Navigate to **Admin** → **Organizations**
2. Click **Create New Organization**
3. Fill in the required information:
   - **Name**: Display name for the organization
   - **Slug**: URL-friendly identifier (must be unique)
   - **Description**: Optional description of the organization's purpose
   - **Website**: Optional organization website URL

### Initial Setup

When creating an organization:
- The creator (you) becomes the first Organization Admin
- The organization starts with no events
- Default settings are applied
- An organization slug is generated for URL routing

- Review user role assignments
- Validate data integrity

**Access problems**

- Validate authentication state

### Performance Issues

**Slow organization queries**

- Optimize organization relationships

**Storage concerns**
- Monitor logo storage usage
- Implement asset cleanup
- Consider CDN for logos
- Archive old organization data

## Best Practices
