# Getting Started

Welcome to the Conducky User Guide!

## First Steps

After logging into Conducky, you'll be directed to your appropriate starting point:

- **First-time users**: Global dashboard with information about joining events
- **Single event users**: Directly to that event's dashboard
- **Multi-event users**: Global dashboard showing all your events
- **SuperAdmins**: System admin dashboard for installation management

## Understanding Navigation

Conducky uses a three-level navigation system:

1. **Global Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) - Your multi-event overview
2. **Event Context** (`/events/[eventSlug]/`) - Event-specific functionality
3. **System Admin** (`/admin/`) - Installation management (SuperAdmins only)

See the [Navigation Guide](./navigation.md) for detailed information about how navigation works.

## Your First Event

### Joining an Event

Most users join events through invitation links sent by event administrators. When you receive an invitation:

1. Click the invitation link
2. Log in or create an account if needed
3. Accept the invitation to join the event with the specified role
4. You'll be redirected to the event dashboard

### Understanding Your Role

Your role in each event determines what you can see and do:

- **Reporter**: Submit reports, view your own reports, see event information
- **Responder**: Handle reports, view all reports, manage report states
- **Admin**: Full event management, team management, event settings

## Environment Variables

Before running Conducky, you must set the required environment variables for both backend and frontend. See the [Developer Docs Introduction](../developer-docs/intro.md#environment-variables-standardized) for the full list and details.
