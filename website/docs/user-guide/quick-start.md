## 🎯 What's Your Role?

### Incidenter (Event Attendee)
**You can:**
- Submit incident reports
- View and track your own incidents
- Add comments to your incidents
- Upload evidence files

**Your workflow:**
1. Something happens → Submit an incident
2. Response team investigates → You receive updates
3. Add comments if you have more information

### Responder (Safety Team Member)
**You can:**
- View all incidents in your events
- Change incident states (investigating, resolved, etc.)
- Add internal and external comments
- Assign incidents to team members

**Your workflow:**
1. New incident arrives → Review details
2. Start investigation → Change state to "investigating"
3. Work the case → Add comments and updates
4. Resolution → Mark as resolved or closed

### Event Admin (Event Organizer)
**You can:**
- Everything Responders can do, plus:
- Manage team members and roles
- Configure event settings
- Create invitation links
- View event analytics and incidents

**Your workflow:**
1. Set up event → Add team members
2. Train your team → Share documentation
3. Monitor incidents → Ensure proper response
4. Review and improve → After-event analysis

### System Admin (System Administrator)
**You can:**
- Create and manage events
- System-wide configuration
- User management across all events
- Access to admin interface

**Important**: System Admins need explicit event roles to access event data! Being a System Admin doesn't automatically grant access to event content - you must be added as an Event Admin, Responder, or Reporter for each event.
