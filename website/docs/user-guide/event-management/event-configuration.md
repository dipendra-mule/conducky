# Event Configuration

Event Admins can configure various aspects of their events through inline editing and dedicated settings pages. This page explains how to manage event metadata, branding, and operational settings.

## Inline Editing of Event Metadata

Event admins can edit event metadata directly from the main event page using an inline editing interface.

### Editable Fields

The following fields can be edited inline:

- **Name**: Event display name
- **Logo**: Event branding image
- **Start Date**: Event start date and time
- **End Date**: Event end date and time
- **Website**: Event website URL
- **Description**: Event description
- **Code of Conduct**: Community guidelines (Markdown supported)
- **Contact Email**: Primary contact for the event

<!-- Screenshot Placeholder -->
> **Screenshot needed**: Event configuration page showing inline editing interface with edit icons

### Who Can Edit

- Only users with the `Admin` role for the event will see edit icons
- System Admins can edit if they have been assigned an Admin role for the event
- Non-admin users cannot edit event metadata

### How Inline Editing Works

1. **Click edit icon**: Pencil icon appears next to editable fields for admins
2. **Edit inline**: Click to enable editing directly on the page
3. **Save changes**: Click checkmark to save, or X to cancel
4. **Immediate updates**: Changes are reflected in the UI upon success
5. **Error handling**: Clear error messages for validation failures

## Event Logo Upload

Event admins can upload custom logos for visual branding.

### Upload Process

1. **Access logo section**: Click the pencil icon next to the current logo (or placeholder)
2. **Select image**: Choose a PNG or JPG file (max 5MB)
3. **Preview**: See how the logo will appear
4. **Save**: Confirm the upload

### Technical Details

- **Storage**: Logos are stored in the database as BLOBs
- **Access**: Retrieved via `GET /events/slug/:slug/logo`
- **Formats**: PNG and JPG supported
- **Size limit**: Maximum 5MB per file
- **Fallback**: Default placeholder shown if no logo uploaded

### Logo Best Practices

1. **Use square or horizontal logos** for best display
2. **Keep file sizes reasonable** (under 1MB recommended)
3. **Use high contrast** for visibility on different backgrounds
4. **Test on mobile devices** to ensure readability
5. **Consider brand consistency** with other event materials
