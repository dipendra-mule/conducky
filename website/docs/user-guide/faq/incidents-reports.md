# Incidents & Reports FAQ

Common questions about submitting, managing, and tracking incident reports.

## Who can submit incidents?

Anyone with at least "Reporter" role in an event can submit incidents. This includes:
- Event attendees (Reporter role)
- Response team members (Responder role)
- Event administrators (Event Admin role)

## Can I submit incidents anonymously?

Currently, anonymous reporting is not available. All incidents require the reporter to be logged in and have appropriate access to the event. This is planned for future releases.

## Who can see my incident?

Report visibility depends on your role and the incident:
- **Reporters**: Can only see their own incidents
- **Responders**: Can see all incidents in events where they have Responder role
- **Event Admins**: Can see all incidents in events they administer

## What happens after I submit an incident?

1. The incident is immediately available to the response team
2. Responders and Event Admins receive notifications (when implemented)
3. The response team can change the incident state (investigating, resolved, etc.)
4. Comments can be added for communication and documentation
5. You'll be able to track progress through the incident detail page

## Can I edit or delete my incident after submitting?

Currently, incidents cannot be edited or deleted by reporters after submission. If you need changes:
- Add a comment with additional information or corrections
- Contact the response team to request changes
- The response team can update incident details if needed

## What information should I include in an incident report?

**Essential information:**
- Clear description of what happened
- When and where the incident occurred
- People involved (if known and relevant)
- Any witnesses or evidence

**Additional helpful details:**
- Screenshots or photos (if appropriate)
- Documentation or messages related to the incident
- Impact on you or others
- Any immediate actions taken

## How do I upload evidence or attachments?

When creating or commenting on an incident:
1. Look for the attachment or file upload section
2. Click "Choose Files" or drag files to the upload area
3. Select appropriate files from your device
4. Files are uploaded securely and only visible to authorized users

## What file types can I upload?

Supported file types typically include:
- **Images**: JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP
- **Documents**: PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT
- **Audio**: MP3, WAV, M4A
- **Video**: MP4, MOV, AVI (size limits apply)

Check with your event administrators for specific file type restrictions.

## How do I track the status of my incident?

You can track your incident through:
1. **Incident detail page**: Shows current state and recent activity
2. **Dashboard notifications**: Alerts for status changes and new comments
3. **Email notifications**: If enabled by your event administrators
4. **Activity timeline**: Complete history of actions and state changes

## What do the different incident states mean?

Common incident states include:
- **Submitted**: Just reported, awaiting initial review
- **Acknowledged**: Response team has seen and acknowledged the report
- **Investigating**: Actively being investigated by the response team
- **Resolved**: Investigation complete, resolution implemented
- **Closed**: Final state, no further action planned

See the [Incident States Guide](../incident-states.md) for detailed explanations.

## Why can't I see certain incidents?

If you can't see incidents you expect:
- **Role limitations**: Reporters can only see their own incidents
- **Event context**: Make sure you're viewing the correct event
- **Privacy settings**: Some incidents may have restricted visibility
- **Account issues**: Verify you're logged into the correct account

## How do I know if there are updates on my incident?

Updates are communicated through:
- **Dashboard notifications**: Visible when you log in
- **Email alerts**: If configured by your event administrators
- **Comment notifications**: When team members add comments
- **State change alerts**: When incident status changes

## Can I submit multiple incidents?

Yes, you can submit as many incident reports as needed. Each incident is tracked separately with its own:
- Unique identifier and reference number
- Individual state and progress tracking
- Separate comment threads and evidence
- Independent resolution timeline

## What if my incident involves someone on the response team?

If your incident involves a response team member:
1. **Submit the report normally** - the system maintains confidentiality
2. **Contact event administrators** who can handle conflicts of interest
3. **Request specific assignment** to team members without conflicts
4. **Escalate to system administrators** if needed for serious issues

## How long does incident resolution typically take?

Resolution times vary based on:
- **Incident complexity**: Simple issues may resolve quickly, complex ones take longer
- **Investigation requirements**: Some incidents need extensive fact-finding
- **Event timing**: During active events, response may be faster
- **Team availability**: Response speed depends on team capacity

Your event administrators can provide typical timelines for their specific process.

## What if I'm not satisfied with the resolution?

If you're not satisfied with how your incident was handled:
1. **Add comments** explaining your concerns to the incident
2. **Contact event administrators** to discuss the resolution
3. **Request review** of the decision or process
4. **Escalate to system administrators** for serious process concerns
5. **Follow your organization's appeal process** if available

## Can I withdraw or close my own incident?

Typically, reporters cannot directly close their own incidents. However, you can:
- **Add a comment** indicating you'd like to withdraw the report
- **Contact the response team** to request closure
- **Explain the situation** if circumstances have changed

The response team will review your request and take appropriate action.
