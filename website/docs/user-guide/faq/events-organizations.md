# Events & Organizations FAQ

Questions about managing multiple events, organizations, and event lifecycle.

## How do I join multiple events?

You can join multiple events by:
1. Receiving invitation links for each event
2. Using invite codes through your profile page (accessible from the user menu)
3. Being directly added by Event Admins

## Can I leave an event?

Yes, you can leave events through your profile page (accessible from the user menu). However:
- This will remove your access to all event data
- You won't be able to see incidents you submitted
- Event Admins can re-invite you if needed

## What happens if an event is disabled?

If an event is disabled by a System Admin:
- Event data remains intact but becomes inaccessible
- Users cannot access the event dashboard or incidents
- Only System Admins can re-enable disabled events

## What's the difference between an event and an organization?

- **Organizations**: Parent entities that can contain multiple events (e.g., "Tech Conference Corp")
- **Events**: Specific instances within organizations (e.g., "TechConf 2024", "TechConf 2025")

Organizations provide shared branding, policies, and management across related events.

## How do organizations work?

Organizations allow for:
- **Shared management**: Organization admins can oversee multiple events
- **Consistent branding**: Events inherit organization logos and themes
- **Unified policies**: Shared code of conduct and procedures
- **Cross-event analytics**: Organization-level reporting and metrics

## Can I be in multiple organizations?

Yes! You can participate in multiple organizations and have different roles in each:
- Different organizations are completely separate
- Your roles in one organization don't affect others
- You can switch between organizations using the navigation

## Who creates events and organizations?

**Organizations:**
- Created by System Admins
- Organization Admins are assigned via invitation

**Events:**
- Created by Organization Admins within their organizations
- Or created by System Admins and assigned to Event Admins

## What happens to my data if I leave an event?

When you leave an event:
- **Your incidents remain** in the system for record-keeping
- **Your comments stay** but you cannot edit them
- **You lose access** to view any event data
- **You can be re-invited** by Event Admins if needed

## Can I transfer my role to someone else?

Role transfers typically require administrator action:
- **Contact Event Admins** to request role changes
- **Provide the new person's information** for invitation
- **Complete any handover processes** your event requires
- **Ensure continuity** of any ongoing responsibilities

## How do I switch between events?

Use the event/organization selector in the navigation:
1. Look for the current event/organization name in the sidebar
2. Click to open the selector dropdown
3. Choose the event or organization you want to switch to
4. The interface will update to reflect your role in the new context

## What if an event I'm involved in gets cancelled?

If an event is cancelled:
- **Data is typically preserved** for record-keeping
- **Access may be maintained** for a period after cancellation
- **Follow your organization's procedures** for data handling
- **Contact administrators** about data export if needed

## Can events be archived or made read-only?

Yes, events can be archived when they're completed:
- **Archived events** become read-only
- **Data is preserved** but no new incidents can be submitted
- **Access is maintained** for historical reference
- **Administrators can reactivate** if needed

## How do I know which events I belong to?

Check your event access through:
- **Global dashboard**: Shows cards for all your events
- **Profile page**: Lists all events and your roles
- **Navigation sidebar**: Displays available events
- **Event selector**: Shows all accessible events and organizations

## What's the event lifecycle?

Events typically progress through these stages:
1. **Creation**: Basic event setup by administrators
2. **Configuration**: Detailed setup including team and policies
3. **Active**: Accepting incidents and fully operational
4. **Closing**: Event ending, final incident resolution
5. **Archived**: Read-only preservation of event data

## Can I create my own events?

Event creation permissions depend on your role:
- **System Admins**: Can create events anywhere
- **Organization Admins**: Can create events within their organizations
- **Event Admins**: Cannot create new events (only manage assigned ones)
- **Other roles**: Cannot create events

## How do I request access to an event?

To request access to an event:
1. **Contact the Event Admins** directly if you know them
2. **Reach out to the organization** that runs the event
3. **Ask for an invitation link** or invite code
4. **Check if the event has public registration** available

## What if I can't access an event I should be able to?

If you can't access an expected event:
1. **Verify you're logged into the correct account**
2. **Check if the event is active** (not disabled or archived)
3. **Confirm your invitation was accepted** properly
4. **Contact Event Admins** to verify your role assignment
5. **Try refreshing your browser** or clearing cache

## Can events have different settings and policies?

Yes, each event can have customized:

- **Incident submission forms** with custom fields
- **Team roles and permissions** tailored to the event
- **Notification settings** and communication preferences
- **Branding and visual appearance** reflecting the event
