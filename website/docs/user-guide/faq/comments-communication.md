# Comments & Communication FAQ

Understanding how to communicate effectively through the incident comment system.

## What's the difference between internal and external comments?

- **External comments**: Visible to everyone who can access the incident
- **Internal comments**: Only visible to Responders and Event Admins

This allows the response team to have private discussions while keeping appropriate information visible to reporters.

## Who can see internal comments?

Reporters and other users cannot see internal comments, even on their own incidents.

## Can I edit or delete my comments?

Yes, you can edit and delete your own comments. Look for the three-dot menu (â‹®) next to your comments for these options.

**Note**: Editing history may be tracked for audit purposes, and some events may have policies about comment modifications.
