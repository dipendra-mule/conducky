# Account Setup

Learn how to create your Conducky account and manage authentication through different methods.

---

## Creating an Account

New users can create an account in several ways depending on how your organization uses Conducky:

### Direct Registration (First User)

Visit `/register` to create a new account when setting up a new Conducky instance:

1. **Navigate** to your organization's Conducky URL + `/register`
2. **Enter** your email address, full name, and password
3. **Password requirements**: 8+ characters, mix of letters, numbers, symbols
4. **Automatic elevation**: The first user to register becomes a System Admin automatically
5. **Next steps**: Subsequent users need invitations to access functionality

:::tip First User Benefits
As the first user, you become a System Admin with full system access. You can create events, manage system settings, and invite other users.

### Invitation Links (Most Common)

Most users join through event invitations sent by administrators:

1. **Click** the invitation link sent by an event administrator
2. **Create account** or log in if you already have one
3. **Accept invitation** to join the event with the specified role
4. **Automatic redirect** to the event dashboard

**Example invitation workflow:**

3. **Go to** `/profile/events`
4. **Enter code** in the "Join Event" section

## Multi-Event Account Management

### Understanding Multi-Event Access

One Conducky account can participate in multiple events with different roles:

- **Same account**: Use one login for all your events
- **Different roles**: You might be a Reporter in one event, Admin in another
- **Separate contexts**: Activities in one event don't affect others
- **Unified profile**: Same name and avatar across all events

### Managing Event Memberships

**From your profile** (`/profile/events`):
- View all events you belong to
- See your role in each event
- Use invite codes to join new events
- Leave events you no longer need access to

**Benefits of multi-event accounts:**
- **Single login**: No need to remember multiple passwords
- **Consistent identity**: Same name and avatar everywhere
- **Cross-event features**: Unified notifications and reporting
- **Easy switching**: Navigate between events seamlessly

## Troubleshooting Account Issues

### Can't Log In

**Check these common issues:**

1. **Correct URL**: Make sure you're on the right Conducky instance
2. **Email address**: Use the exact email you registered with
3. **Password**: Try resetting if you're unsure
4. **Account status**: Your account might be disabled - contact administrators

- Browser blocking the redirect

**Solutions:**
