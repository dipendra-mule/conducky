# Understanding Roles

Learn about the different user roles in Conducky and what permissions each role provides.

---

## Role Overview

Conducky uses a comprehensive role-based access control system with two types of roles:

### System-Level Roles
- **System Admin**: System-wide management capabilities
- **Regular User**: Standard user with no system privileges (most users)

### Event-Level Roles
- **Event Admin**: Full management of a specific event
- **Responder**: Report management and team coordination within an event
- **Reporter**: Basic report submission and viewing within an event

:::info Multi-Role Support
You can have different roles in different events. For example, you might be an Event Admin for one conference and a Reporter for another.

## Understanding Role Assignment

Roles in Conducky are assigned based on functional needs and responsibilities, not seniority or progression:

### Role Assignment Principles

- **Functional necessity**: Users receive roles based on what they need to accomplish
- **Event-specific**: Role assignments are tailored to each event's requirements
- **Administrative decision**: Event Admins assign roles based on team needs
- **No hierarchy**: Roles represent different functions, not levels of authority

### Role Assignment Examples

**Reporter role** is assigned to:
- Event attendees who may need to submit incident reports
- Community members participating in the event
- Anyone who needs basic access to report incidents

**Responder role** is assigned to:
- Code of conduct team members
- Safety officers and event staff
- Volunteers trained in incident response

**Event Admin role** is assigned to:
- Event organizers and coordinators
- Lead safety officers
- Those responsible for team management

**System Admin role** is assigned to:
- Technical administrators
- Platform maintainers
- Those responsible for system-wide operations

## Multi-Event Role Management

### Different Roles in Different Events

You can have completely different roles across events:

**Example scenarios:**
- **Conference A**: Event Admin (you organize this conference)
- **Conference B**: Responder (you volunteer for their safety team)
- **Conference C**: Reporter (you attend as a regular participant)

### Managing Multiple Roles

**Navigation considerations:**
- Sidebar changes based on your role in the current event
- Global dashboard shows all your events with role indicators
- Cross-event features respect your highest permission level

**Responsibility management:**
- Set different notification preferences for different roles
- Use the global reports dashboard to manage Responder/Admin workload
- Switch between events easily using the event selector

## Getting Help with Roles

### Understanding Your Current Role

**To check your role in an event:**
1. Go to the event dashboard
2. Look at the sidebar navigation (shows role-appropriate options)
3. Check the event card on your global dashboard
4. Visit the team page (if you have access)

### Role-Related Questions

**Common questions:**
- **"Why can't I see other reports?"** - You likely have Reporter role
- **"Why can't I invite users?"** - You need Event Admin role
- **"Why can't I access event data as System Admin?"** - System Admins need explicit event roles

### Requesting Role Changes

**To request a role change:**
1. Contact the Event Admin for the specific event
2. Explain why you need additional permissions
3. Demonstrate competence in your current role
4. Be patient - role changes require trust and consideration
