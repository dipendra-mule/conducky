## Multi-Event Profile Management

### Consistent Identity

**Benefits of unified profile:**
- **Same name**: Consistent identity across all events
- **Single login**: One password for all your events
- **Unified settings**: Notification preferences apply everywhere
- **Cross-event features**: Global dashboard and reporting

### Role-Specific Considerations

**Different roles, same profile:**
- Your profile information is the same across all events
- Your permissions change based on your role in each event
- Notification preferences can be customized per event
- Activity history is tracked separately for each event

### Privacy Across Events

**Event isolation:**
- Event teams cannot see your participation in other events
- Your activity in one event doesn't affect others
- Each event maintains separate audit logs
- Data is strictly scoped to individual events
