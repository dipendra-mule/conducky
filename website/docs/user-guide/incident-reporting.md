# Incident Reporting Guide

This guide covers everything you need to know about submitting incident reports in Conducky. Incident reporting is the primary function most users will perform, so we've made it as simple and secure as possible.

## üöÄ Quick Start: Submit Your First Report

### Getting to the Report Form

There are several ways to submit an incident report:

#### 1. **From the Global Dashboard**
- Navigate to your dashboard
- Look for the prominent "Submit Report" section
- Click the button for your event (or select from dropdown if you're in multiple events)

#### 2. **From an Event Dashboard**
- Go to your event's main page
- Click the "Submit Report" button in the Quick Actions section

#### 3. **Direct Link**
- Navigate directly to `/events/[event-name]/incidents/new`

#### 4. **Keyboard Shortcut**
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (or `Cmd+Shift+R` on Mac) from anywhere in the app
- This works for single-event users or opens a selector for multi-event users

## üìù The Incident Reporting Process

### Step 1: Basic Information

**Incident Title** (Required)
- Provide a concise summary in 10-70 characters
- Think of this as a subject line that helps responders quickly understand the issue
- Examples: "Harassment during keynote", "Unsafe booth behavior", "Code of conduct violation"

**Incident Description** (Required)
- Describe what happened in as much or as little detail as you're comfortable sharing
- Include relevant context like when, where, and who was involved
- You can use markdown formatting if needed
- No character limit - share what feels right for you

### Step 2: Context Details (All Optional)

**Date and Time of Incident**
- When did this happen? Can be approximate
- Helps responders understand timeline and context
- Cannot be more than 24 hours in the future (to prevent accidental future dates)

**Location**
- Where did this occur? (up to 200 characters)
- Can be as specific or general as you prefer
- Examples: "Main conference hall", "Registration desk", "Sponsor booth area"

**Involved Parties**
- Who was involved? (up to 500 characters)
- You can use names, descriptions, or whatever level of detail you're comfortable with
- This helps responders understand the scope and identify relevant people

### Step 3: Related Files and Attachments

You can optionally upload supporting files:

- **Screenshots**: Capture error messages or relevant visuals.
- **Documents**: Attach relevant policies, logs, or reports.
- **Photos**: Provide visual context of the incident location.

*All attachments are stored securely and are only accessible to authorized responders.*

### Step 4: Review and Submit

If you're a responder or event admin, you'll see an additional "Urgency Level" field:
- **Low**: Non-urgent issues that can be addressed during normal hours
- **Medium**: Issues that should be addressed soon but aren't emergencies
- **High**: Urgent issues requiring prompt attention
- **Critical**: Immediate safety concerns requiring immediate response

Regular reporters don't see this field - the response team will assess urgency when they review your report.

## Data Privacy and Security

Your privacy and security are our top priorities:

- **Confidentiality**: Your identity as a reporter is protected and only shared with the response team on a need-to-know basis.
- **Secure Storage**: All incident data and attachments are encrypted at rest.
- **Access Control**: Only authorized response team members can access incident details.

For more information, see our [Security Overview](../security/overview.md).
