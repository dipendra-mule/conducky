# Incident Reporting Guide

This guide covers everything you need to know about submitting incident reports in Conducky. Incident reporting is the primary function most users will perform, so we've made it as simple and secure as possible.

## üöÄ Quick Start: Submit Your First Report

### Getting to the Report Form

There are several ways to submit an incident report:

#### 1. **From the Global Dashboard**
- Navigate to your dashboard
- Look for the prominent "Submit Report" section
- Click the button for your event (or select from dropdown if you're in multiple events)

#### 2. **From an Event Dashboard**
- Go to your event's main page
- Click the "Submit Report" button in the Quick Actions section

#### 3. **Direct Link**
- Navigate directly to `/events/[event-name]/incidents/new`

#### 4. **Keyboard Shortcut**
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (or `Cmd+Shift+R` on Mac) from anywhere in the app
- This works for single-event users or opens a selector for multi-event users

## üìù The Incident Reporting Process

### Step 1: Basic Information

**Incident Title** (Required)
- Provide a concise summary in 10-70 characters
- Think of this as a subject line that helps responders quickly understand the issue
- Examples: "Harassment during keynote", "Unsafe booth behavior", "Code of conduct violation"

**Incident Description** (Required)
- Describe what happened in as much or as little detail as you're comfortable sharing
- Include relevant context like when, where, and who was involved
- You can use markdown formatting if needed
- No character limit - share what feels right for you

### Step 2: Context Details (All Optional)

**Date and Time of Incident**
- When did this happen? Can be approximate
- Helps responders understand timeline and context
- Cannot be more than 24 hours in the future (to prevent accidental future dates)

**Location**
- Where did this occur? (up to 200 characters)
- Can be as specific or general as you prefer
- Examples: "Main conference hall", "Registration desk", "Sponsor booth area"

**Involved Parties**
- Who was involved? (up to 500 characters)
- You can use names, descriptions, or whatever level of detail you're comfortable with
- This helps responders understand the scope and identify relevant people

### Step 3: Evidence and Attachments

You can optionally upload supporting evidence:

**Supported File Types:**
- Screenshots and photos
- Documents (PDF, Word, etc.)
- Audio/video files
- Chat logs or email screenshots

**How to Upload:**
- Drag and drop files onto the upload area
- Click "Choose Files" to browse your device
- Multiple files can be uploaded
- Files are stored securely and only accessible to authorized response team members

### Step 4: Urgency Setting (Response Team Only)

If you're a responder or event admin, you'll see an additional "Urgency Level" field:
- **Low**: Non-urgent issues that can be addressed during normal hours
- **Medium**: Issues that should be addressed soon but aren't emergencies
- **High**: Urgent issues requiring prompt attention
- **Critical**: Immediate safety concerns requiring immediate response

Regular reporters don't see this field - the response team will assess urgency when they review your report.

## üîí Privacy and Security

### Authenticated Reporting
- All reports require you to be logged in with a verified account
- Your identity is only visible to authorized response team members
- Reports are never made public with identifying information
- Data is encrypted at rest for additional security

### Who Can See Your Report?
1. **You** - The person who submitted it
2. **Event Response Team** - Responders and event administrators
3. **Assigned Responder** - If your report gets assigned to someone specific
4. **System Administrators** - For technical support only

### Data Protection
- All sensitive report data is encrypted in the database
- Evidence files are stored securely with access controls
- Reports are never shared between different events
- You have the right to request deletion of your data
