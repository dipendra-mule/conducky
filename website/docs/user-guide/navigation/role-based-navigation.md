# Role-Based Navigation

*System Admins need event roles to access event data
**System Admins without event roles cannot access event-specific data

## Role Indicators

Throughout the navigation, you'll see role indicators that help you understand your permissions:

- **Admin badge**: Shows when you have Event Admin role
- **Responder badge**: Shows when you have Responder role  
- **Reporter badge**: Shows when you have Reporter role
- **System Admin indicator**: Shows in the user menu when you have system-level access

## Switching Between Contexts

### For System Admins
System Admins can easily switch between system administration and personal contexts:

1. **System Admin Context**: Use the dedicated admin section in the sidebar
2. **Personal Context**: Use the regular navigation to access your events
3. **Event Context**: Join events as needed to access event-specific data

### For Multi-Role Users
If you have different roles in different events:

1. **Event switcher** shows your role in each event
2. **Navigation adapts** when you switch events
3. **Permissions change** based on your role in the current event
4. **Global features** remain consistent across all events

## Understanding Navigation Changes

When you switch roles or contexts, you may notice:

- **Menu items appear/disappear** based on permissions
- **Submenu options change** depending on your role
- **Action buttons** are shown/hidden based on what you can do
- **Event-specific sections** only show for events you belong to

This dynamic navigation ensures you only see options you can actually use, reducing confusion and improving the user experience.
