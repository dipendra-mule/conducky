# Mobile Navigation

Conducky is designed with mobile-first principles, ensuring that navigation works seamlessly on smartphones and tablets. This page covers mobile-specific navigation features and best practices.

## Mobile-First Design

### Responsive Sidebar Navigation

The sidebar navigation automatically adapts to mobile devices:

- **Collapsible sidebar**: Automatically collapses on mobile devices with hamburger menu
- **Overlay mode**: Sidebar overlays content on mobile instead of pushing it
- **Touch-friendly**: All navigation elements are optimized for touch interaction
- **Context awareness**: Mobile navigation maintains the same context-aware behavior as desktop
