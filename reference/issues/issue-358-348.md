# Issues 358 & 348 Implementation Plan

**Branch:** `issues/issue-358-348`  
**Created:** January 27, 2025  

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for two related GitHub issues that enhance user experience and audit visibility:

- **Issue #358**: Public event dashboard should include code of conduct
- **Issue #348**: Org audit table should show the associated event for the audit entry if applicable

## Issue Analysis

### Issue #358: Public Event Dashboard Code of Conduct
**Current State:** 
- Public event dashboard at `/events/[eventSlug]` exists and is functional
- Code of conduct is conditionally displayed in a card section if `event.codeOfConduct` exists
- There's also a dedicated `/events/[eventSlug]/code-of-conduct` page

**Problem:** 
- The public event dashboard includes code of conduct, but it may need enhancement or there might be a specific issue with the current implementation

**Investigation Needed:**
- Verify current behavior with test data
- Check if there are edge cases or formatting issues
- Ensure the code of conduct section is prominently displayed and accessible

### Issue #348: Organization Audit Table Event Association
**Current State:**
- Organization audit page exists at `/orgs/[orgSlug]/audit`
- Uses `AuditLogTable` component that displays audit logs
- Currently shows: timestamp, action, target, user, and organization (for system scope)

**Problem:**
- When viewing organization audit logs, entries related to specific events don't show which event they're associated with
- This makes it difficult to understand the context of event-related audit entries

**Required Enhancement:**
- Add event name/identifier column for event-related audit entries
- Modify the audit log data structure to include event information
- Update both backend API and frontend display

## Technical Analysis

### Issue #358 Investigation

Looking at the current implementation in `/frontend/pages/events/[eventSlug]/index.tsx`, I can see:

1. **Code of Conduct Section Already Exists** (lines 398-426):
   ```tsx
   {/* Code of Conduct */}
   {event.codeOfConduct && (
     <Card>
       <CardHeader>
         <CardTitle className="flex items-center gap-2">
           <FileText className="h-5 w-5 text-purple-600" />
           Code of Conduct
         </CardTitle>
       </CardHeader>
       <CardContent>
         <div className="prose dark:prose-invert max-w-none max-h-96 overflow-y-auto">
           <SecureMarkdown content={event.codeOfConduct || ""} type="event" />
         </div>
         <div className="mt-4 pt-4 border-t border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700">
           <Button 
             onClick={() => router.push(`/events/${event.slug}/code-of-conduct`)}
             variant="outline"
             size="sm"
           >
             View Full Code of Conduct
           </Button>
         </div>
       </CardContent>
     </Card>
   )}
   ```

2. **Issue Hypothesis:** The issue might be:
   - Code of conduct not showing when it should
   - Formatting or display issues
   - Need for better prominence or accessibility
   - Missing for events that should have one

### Issue #348 Technical Requirements

**Database Schema Analysis:**
- `AuditLog` table exists with: `id`, `timestamp`, `action`, `targetType`, `targetId`, `userId`, `organizationId`, `eventId`
- The `eventId` field exists but isn't being utilized in the display

**Current Query Behavior:**
- Organization audit logs are fetched via `/api/organizations/[orgId]/audit`
- The backend needs to include event information when `eventId` is present
- The frontend `AuditLogTable` component needs to display event information

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Issue #358 - Public Event Dashboard Code of Conduct ✅

**Step 1.1: Investigation and Testing**
- [ ] Create test events with and without code of conduct
- [ ] Test the public dashboard functionality
- [ ] Identify specific issues or enhancement needs
- [ ] Document current behavior vs expected behavior

**Step 1.2: Enhancements (if needed)**
- [ ] Improve code of conduct section visibility
- [ ] Add better formatting or layout
- [ ] Ensure accessibility compliance
- [ ] Add tests for code of conduct display functionality

### Phase 2: Issue #348 - Organization Audit Table Event Association ✅

**Step 2.1: Backend API Enhancement**
- [ ] Update audit log queries to include event information
- [ ] Modify `AuditLogEntry` type to include event data
- [ ] Update organization audit log endpoint
- [ ] Add event information to audit log responses

**Step 2.2: Frontend Display Enhancement**
- [ ] Update `AuditLogTable` component to support event column
- [ ] Add event display for organization scope audit logs
- [ ] Update types and interfaces
- [ ] Ensure responsive design works with new column

**Step 2.3: Testing**
- [ ] Add tests for new audit log event information

### Issue #348
- [ ] Organization audit table shows event name for event-related entries
- [ ] Event information is clear and helpful for context
- [ ] Existing audit log functionality unchanged
- [ ] Responsive design maintained
- [ ] No performance impact from additional data

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk:**
- Both changes are enhancements to existing functionality
- Well-defined scope with clear requirements
- Existing test coverage provides regression protection

**Mitigation:**
- Incremental implementation with testing at each step
- Backward compatibility maintained
