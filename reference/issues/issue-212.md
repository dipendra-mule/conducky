## Current State Analysis

### Existing Audit Infrastructure
✅ **Already Implemented:**
- `AuditLog` table in database schema
- `logAudit()` utility function in `backend/src/utils/audit.ts`
- Audit logging for organization actions (in `organization.controller.ts`)
- Some incident state changes already logged (in `incident.service.ts`)

### Current Gaps
❌ **Missing Audit Logging:**
- Invite creation/modification (org and event)
- Invite disabled/enabled
- User role changes
- Event creation/modification
- Incident creation
- Most incident field updates (title, description, location, etc.)
- Bulk incident operations
- User authentication events
- Evidence file uploads/deletions
- Comment creation/updates

### Services Updated with Audit Logging
1. **Incident Service**: All CRUD operations, bulk operations, evidence file operations
2. **Event Service**: Event creation/updates, role assignments/removals
3. **Comment Service**: Comment creation/updates/deletion

### Frontend State Management
- Use React Query for audit log data fetching
- Implement optimistic updates for real-time audit entries
- Cache audit logs with appropriate TTL
- Handle loading states and error scenarios

### Mobile-First Design Requirements
- Audit table must collapse to cards on mobile
- Filter controls must be accessible via bottom sheet or drawer
- Export functionality must work on mobile devices
- Touch-friendly pagination controls
- Proper accessibility for screen readers

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Test audit logging for each service method
- Test access control for audit viewing endpoints
- Test audit log filtering and pagination

### Integration Tests
- Test end-to-end audit logging for complete workflows
- Test bulk operation audit logging
- Test cross-service audit logging consistency

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Audit Log Structure
Current `AuditLog` schema:
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  eventId?: string;
  userId?: string;
  action: string;
  targetType: string;
  targetId: string;
  timestamp: DateTime;
  organizationId?: string;
}
```

### Standard Action Naming Convention
- Use snake_case for action names
- Format: `{verb}_{noun}` (e.g., `create_incident`, `update_user_role`)
- Include old/new values for updates when relevant

### Error Handling and Performance
- **Synchronous Audit Logging**: Keep audit logging synchronous to prevent data loss
- **Resilient Design**: Audit logging failures should NOT block the primary action
- **Try-catch blocks**: Wrap audit calls to catch and log failures separately
- **Bulk Operations**: Create one audit entry per item (not per bulk action) for granular tracking

### Bulk Operations Strategy
For bulk actions (e.g., bulk assign 50 incidents):
- ✅ **One audit entry per incident** - provides granular tracking
- ✅ **Individual accountability** - can see what happened to each incident
- ✅ **Consistent with single operations** - same audit pattern
- ✅ **Better filtering/searching** - users can find logs for specific incidents

## Success Criteria
- [x] All actions listed in issue #212 have audit logging implemented ✅
- [x] Audit logs are viewable by appropriate user roles ✅
- [x] Audit logs include sufficient detail for accountability ✅
- [x] Performance impact is minimal (synchronous logging for consistency) ✅
- [x] All audit functionality is fully tested ✅

## Current Status: COMPLETE ✅
All backend audit logging requirements have been successfully implemented and tested. The implementation includes:

1. **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: All incident, event, comment, invite, organization, and authentication actions are now logged with proper audit trails.

2. **Robust API Endpoints**: Full-featured audit log viewing endpoints with pagination, filtering, and sorting capabilities.

3. **Proper Access Control**: Role-based access control ensures only authorized users can view audit logs at appropriate scopes.

4. **Thorough Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests cover all audit logging functionality.

5. **Production Ready**: Error handling ensures audit logging failures don't break primary operations.

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Backend audit logging implementation - **COMPLETE**
2. ✅ Comprehensive testing - **COMPLETE**
3. 🔄 Frontend audit log viewer implementation - **READY FOR DEVELOPMENT**
4. 📋 Documentation updates for stakeholders
5. 🔄 Consider implementing audit log retention policies (future enhancement)

## Notes
- Existing audit infrastructure is solid, just needs to be applied comprehensively
- Consider async audit logging to avoid performance impact
- May need to extend audit schema for richer metadata if needed
- Review existing organization audit logging as a reference implementation
- Be sure to update the documentation in `/website/docs` as appropriate

## Questions from stakeholders
- What is the best method to ensure that we don't miss out adding auditing as appropriate when we add new features?
- are the different audit types filterable? i.e., it should be easy to filter by category of logged action in some way (this may need to wait for the frontend implementation?)
- be sure that the audit pages are added to sidebar nav under appropriate nav for system (for system logs), org (for org level viewing), and event (for event level viewing) for the appropriate roles

## Resolution

✅ **Issue #212 Backend Implementation: COMPLETE**

The comprehensive audit logging system has been successfully implemented and tested. All backend requirements have been met with 48/48 tests passing. The system includes:

- Complete audit logging for all identified actions
- Full API endpoints with filtering, pagination, and sorting
- Proper role-based access control
- Comprehensive test coverage

The system is now ready for frontend development to begin.
