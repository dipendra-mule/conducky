# Issues Review and Plan - July 18, 2025

## Issue Analysis Results

After thoroughly reviewing the codebase and examining each GitHub issue, here's my assessment of their current validity:

### ❌ Issues to Close (No Longer Valid)

#### 1. [Issue #195 - Memory leak risk in password reset rate limiting](https://github.com/mattstratton/conducky/issues/195)
**Status**: RESOLVED - No longer applicable
**Reason**: The `resetAttempts = new Map<string, number[]>()` mentioned in the issue no longer exists in the codebase. The password reset functionality has been refactored and the memory leak risk has been eliminated.
**Action**: ✅ CLOSED - Issue closed with explanation.

#### 2. [Issue #303 - Refactor repetitive JSON parsing logic](https://github.com/mattstratton/conducky/issues/303)  
**Status**: RESOLVED - Already implemented
**Reason**: The specific repetitive JSON parsing logic mentioned in the issue (multiple try/catch blocks for email, googleOAuth, githubOAuth) no longer exists in `backend/src/routes/admin.routes.ts`. The current implementation uses a single JSON.parse operation for email settings without the repetitive pattern described.
**Action**: ✅ CLOSED - Issue closed with explanation.

#### 3. [Issue #199 - Fix pagination count for unique users](https://github.com/mattstratton/conducky/issues/199)
**Status**: RESOLVED - Already fixed  
**Reason**: The pagination count issue has been addressed. The current implementation in `backend/src/services/event.service.ts` uses optimized queries and the unified RBAC system properly handles unique user counting. The specific UserEventRole counting issue mentioned in the issue no longer exists.
**Action**: ✅ CLOSED - Issue closed with explanation.

### ✅ Issues That Remain Valid

#### 1. [Issue #319 - Keyboard shortcuts break keyboard nav](https://github.com/mattstratton/conducky/issues/319)
**Status**: VALID - Needs investigation
**Current Implementation**: Keyboard shortcuts are implemented in `frontend/hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts.ts` with proper exclusions for input fields, but the specific dropdown navigation issue mentioned needs testing.
**Priority**: Medium
**Phase**: 2

#### 2. [Issue #354 - environment.ts file in backend is out of date](https://github.com/mattstratton/conducky/issues/354)  
**Status**: VALID - Needs cleanup
**Current State**: The `backend/src/config/environment.ts` file contains several environment variables that are properly structured but could benefit from review and cleanup.
**Priority**: Low
**Phase**: 3

#### 3. [Issue #179 - User enumeration vulnerability](https://github.com/mattstratton/conducky/issues/179)
**Status**: VALID - Security issue
**Current Implementation**: The `/auth/check-email` endpoint exists in `backend/src/routes/auth.routes.ts` and `backend/src/controllers/auth.controller.ts` and does allow unauthenticated email enumeration.
**Priority**: High (Security)
**Phase**: 1

#### 4. [Issue #137 - Restrict incident API responses to minimal fields for unauthorized users](https://github.com/mattstratton/conducky/issues/137)
**Status**: VALID - Enhancement needed
**Current State**: The incident service has role-based access control, but the API responses could be further restricted for unauthorized users.
**Priority**: Medium
**Phase**: 2

#### 5. [Issue #182 - Improve password strength validation](https://github.com/mattstratton/conducky/issues/182)
**Status**: VALID - Enhancement needed  
**Current State**: Password validation exists in backend services but frontend validation could be bypassed and stronger validation could be implemented.
**Priority**: Medium
**Phase**: 1

#### 6. [Issue #197 - Replace imprecise string matching with exact error type checking](https://github.com/mattstratton/conducky/issues/197)
**Status**: VALID - Code quality improvement
**Current State**: Found multiple instances in route files using `.includes()` for error matching that could cause false positives.
**Priority**: Medium
**Phase**: 3

#### 7. [Issue #215 - Improve error message string matching precision](https://github.com/mattstratton/conducky/issues/215)
**Status**: VALID - Code quality improvement (Similar to #197)
**Current State**: Same issue as #197 - imprecise string matching in error handling.
**Priority**: Medium
**Phase**: 3
