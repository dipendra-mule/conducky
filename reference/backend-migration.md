# Backend TypeScript Migration Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of migrating the Conducky backend from JavaScript to TypeScript.

## Migration Strategy
**Approach**: Incremental route migration (changed from monolithic migration due to type complexity)

**Rationale**: The original approach of migrating the entire 3,547-line `index.js` file to TypeScript at once created overwhelming type conflicts between Express, Passport, Prisma, and custom middleware. The incremental approach allows us to:
1. Get a working TypeScript foundation
2. Add routes gradually with proper typing
3. Maintain test coverage throughout the process
4. Avoid complex type interaction issues

## Current Status: 🚀 PHASE 3 IN PROGRESS - Event Management Routes

**Test Progress**: 135/156 tests passing (86.5% success rate, up from 62.8%)
**Test Suites**: 8 passing, 2 failed (10 total)

### ✅ **COMPLETED PHASES**

#### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure ✅
- TypeScript compilation working (0 errors)
- Docker environment stable
- Database integration with Prisma
- Session management and middleware
- Basic route structure established

#### Phase 2: Core Authentication System ✅
- User registration with validation
- Login/logout functionality  
- Password reset workflow (forgot/reset/validate)
- Email availability checking
- Session management with user roles
- Rate limiting and security features

#### Phase 3: Event Management Routes 🚀 IN PROGRESS
**Progress**: Major routes implemented, 62.8% overall test success, 80% events test success

**✅ Implemented Routes**:
- `POST /events` - Event creation (SuperAdmin only)

- [ ] Complete documentation

**Next Milestone**: Complete Phase 3 by implementing remaining event management routes to reach 90%+ test success rate. Only 21 more tests needed!

## Files Status

### ✅ Completed Files
- `backend/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration

### 🧪 Test Status
- **Compilation**: ✅ All TypeScript files compile successfully (0 errors)
- **Core Functionality**: ✅ Authentication, password reset, RBAC, audit logging all working
- **Integration Tests**: ❌ 101 failing (expected - routes not yet migrated)
- **Test Coverage**: Will improve as routes are added incrementally

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Test suite: <10 failing tests (only edge cases)
- [ ] Code coverage: >80% for migrated routes
- [ ] Performance: Response times equivalent to JavaScript version

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Type Complexity**: Complex Express/Passport/Prisma type interactions
   - **Mitigation**: ✅ RESOLVED - Use pragmatic typing, refine incrementally
2. **Test Coverage Loss**: Risk of breaking functionality during migration
   - **Mitigation**: ✅ WORKING - Incremental migration with continuous testing
3. **Performance Regression**: TypeScript compilation overhead
   - **Mitigation**: Monitor response times, optimize if needed

### Rollback Plan
- Original `index.js` remains functional
- Can switch back by updating package.json scripts
- Database schema unchanged, no data migration needed

## Current Development Issues

### User Environment Setup Issues
The user is experiencing some local development setup issues:
1. **Missing dependencies**: `tsc` command not found, `nodemon` command not found
2. **Module resolution**: Express module not found in root directory
3. **Script availability**: Some npm scripts not available in root package.json

**Recommendation**: Use Docker Compose for development as intended:
```bash
# From project root
docker-compose up backend
```

This avoids local Node.js/npm version conflicts and ensures consistent environment.
