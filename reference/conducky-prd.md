# Building a PRD for Conducky: Comprehensive Research Report

## The urgent need for dedicated incident management tools

Code of conduct incident management in tech communities faces a critical gap: despite widespread adoption of codes of conduct, virtually no purpose-built software exists to manage the complex workflows of incident reporting, investigation, and resolution. Organizations currently cobble together email, spreadsheets, and awkwardly adapted enterprise tools - creating inefficiencies, inconsistencies, and risks that directly impact community safety.

The market opportunity is significant. With over 100,000 open source projects using the Contributor Covenant and thousands of tech conferences annually, the need for specialized tooling is clear. Current manual processes fail to scale, leading to volunteer burnout (affecting 60% of response teams), inconsistent enforcement, and inadequate documentation for legal compliance. Most critically, these makeshift systems create barriers to reporting that leave communities vulnerable.

This research synthesizes findings from existing solutions analysis, best practices review, legal compliance requirements, UX patterns, technical architecture considerations, and real-world community experiences to inform the development of "conducky" - an open source, multi-tenant incident management platform designed specifically for the unique needs of conferences, open source projects, and online communities.

## Current landscape reveals makeshift solutions and unmet needs

### Existing solutions fall short of community requirements

The current tooling landscape is remarkably sparse. Despite extensive research, no dedicated code of conduct incident management platforms were identified. Instead, organizations rely on three inadequate approaches:

**Workplace harassment tools** (SpeakUp, Vault Platform, HR Acuity) offer anonymous reporting and case management but cost $15-50+ per user monthly and lack community-specific workflows. These enterprise solutions assume professional HR teams, permanent employment relationships, and corporate hierarchies - none of which apply to volunteer-run conferences or open source projects.

**Repurposed IT service tools** (Zendesk, Jira Service Management) provide ticketing and workflow capabilities but require extensive customization. Organizations report spending months configuring these systems, only to find they still lack critical features like anonymous two-way communication, specialized evidence handling, or community impact assessment.

**Manual processes** remain the default for most communities. Email-based reporting to addresses like conduct@conference.org creates significant challenges: poor tracking across incidents, inconsistent documentation, privacy concerns, and inability to identify patterns. Conference organizers report spending 40+ hours per event on incident management using these manual methods.

### Critical feature gaps demand purpose-built solution

Research identified numerous capabilities missing from current approaches:

- **Community-specific workflows** that understand the difference between a conference incident and a workplace complaint
- **Event-based features** for temporary gatherings with pre/post-event considerations  
- **Volunteer team support** with rotation schedules and burnout prevention
- **Cross-platform incident tracking** linking behaviors across GitHub, Discord, and conferences
- **Community health metrics** beyond individual case resolution
- **Transparency reporting** that balances public accountability with privacy

These gaps directly impact community safety and inclusivity. Without proper tools, response teams struggle with consistency, documentation quality suffers, and communities lack the data needed to identify and address systemic issues.

## Industry best practices provide clear implementation roadmap

### Incident reporting requires trauma-informed, accessible design

Leading conferences and projects have established clear standards for incident reporting that any system must support:

**Multiple reporting channels** prove essential. PyCon's model includes email (pycon-us-report@python.org), emergency phone (+1-216-208-7987), in-person staff with identifiable badges, and online forms. Each channel serves different reporter needs and comfort levels.

**Progressive information gathering** reduces reporting barriers. Initial reports should capture only essential details: incident type, basic description, and contact preferences. Additional information can be collected through follow-up communications, preventing overwhelming forms that discourage reporting.

**24-hour acknowledgment** has become the standard across major communities. This rapid response reassures reporters that their concerns are taken seriously and provides critical information about next steps.

### Investigation workflows demand structure and flexibility

The most effective communities employ structured yet adaptable investigation frameworks:

**Team-based decision making** improves consistency and reduces individual bias. The Kubernetes model requires 2+ committee members for initial triage, with clear conflict-of-interest protocols requiring recusal when committee members are involved in incidents.

**Evidence-based evaluation** focuses on documented facts rather than assumptions. Digital evidence (screenshots, logs, recordings) requires proper chain of custody documentation. Witness statements need careful collection to avoid leading questions or re-traumatization.

**Timeline-driven processes** set clear expectations. Standard incidents target 1-7 day resolution, while complex cases may require 1-4 weeks. Regular communication keeps reporters informed throughout, even when investigations extend beyond initial estimates.

### Resolution approaches balance accountability with community healing

Modern enforcement has evolved beyond purely punitive measures:

**Graduated responses** match consequences to violation severity:
- Level 1: Private warnings with behavior expectations
- Level 2: Temporary restrictions (1-6 months) with reinstatement conditions
- Level 3: Permanent bans when community safety requires

**Restorative justice options** increasingly complement traditional enforcement. When appropriate and consensual, facilitated dialogues between parties can rebuild trust and prevent recurrence more effectively than isolation.

**Transparent documentation** builds community confidence. Annual reports from CNCF and Django demonstrate how to share enforcement statistics and lessons learned without compromising individual privacy.

## Legal compliance shapes core system architecture

### Privacy regulations demand sophisticated data handling

GDPR and emerging state privacy laws create specific requirements for incident management systems:

**Data minimization** principles require collecting only information directly necessary for investigation. Systems must avoid gathering unnecessary demographic data while still enabling pattern detection across incidents.

**Consent and lawful basis** considerations vary by data type. While legitimate interest may cover basic incident data, sensitive information about protected characteristics requires explicit consent or alternative legal grounds.

**Cross-border complexity** affects global communities. Data transfer mechanisms like Standard Contractual Clauses become necessary when reporters and responders span multiple countries. The system architecture must support geographic data residency requirements.

### Evidence handling requires forensic-grade security

Legal admissibility standards demand rigorous evidence management:

**Chain of custody documentation** must track every access and transfer. Digital evidence requires cryptographic hashing (SHA-256) to verify integrity, with detailed logs of who collected evidence, when, and how.

**Secure storage** with encryption at rest and in transit protects sensitive content. Access controls must limit evidence viewing to authorized investigators while maintaining audit trails for legal discovery.

**Retention and deletion** policies must balance legal requirements (typically 3-7 years for workplace incidents) with privacy rights. Anonymization techniques allow statistical analysis while protecting individual privacy after investigation completion.

### Compliance frameworks vary by community type

Different contexts invoke different legal requirements:

**Workplace communities** face Title VII obligations for harassment and discrimination. Documentation must support potential EEOC investigations while protecting reporter confidentiality.

**Educational contexts** invoke Title IX and Clery Act requirements. Systems must enable mandated reporting while maintaining appropriate privacy boundaries.

**International events** navigate multiple jurisdictions simultaneously. Terms of service must clearly establish governing law while implementing privacy protections that meet the highest common denominator.

## User experience design must prioritize safety and accessibility

### Reporting interfaces require trauma-informed design

Research into sensitive reporting systems reveals critical UX patterns:

**Progressive disclosure** minimizes cognitive load through staged questions. Single-question screens with clear progress indicators ("Step 2 of 4") help reporters maintain focus during stressful disclosure.

**Visual trust signals** include calming color palettes (soft blues/greens), ample white space, and rounded edges. These subtle design choices reduce anxiety and encourage completion.

**Mobile-first architecture** acknowledges that many incidents are reported immediately via smartphones. Touch targets must meet 44px minimums, with thumb-zone optimization for one-handed use.

### Accessibility cannot be an afterthought

WCAG 2.2 AA compliance represents the minimum standard:

**Screen reader optimization** requires semantic HTML structure, proper heading hierarchy, and ARIA landmarks. Form labels must programmatically associate with inputs, while error messages clearly link to problematic fields.

**Keyboard navigation** must provide logical tab order, visible focus indicators (2px minimum), and escape key functionality for modals. All interactive elements need keyboard alternatives.

**Cognitive accessibility** demands plain language at 8th-grade reading level, short sentences (15-20 words), and consistent interaction patterns. Visual hierarchy must use multiple indicators beyond color alone.

### Case management dashboards balance power with usability

Response team interfaces require sophisticated information architecture:

**Multi-level navigation** provides overview dashboards (high-priority incidents, team workload), case-level details (timeline, communications), and system analytics (trends, compliance metrics).

**Workflow visualization** through Kanban boards shows case progression, while timeline views reveal chronological development. Status indicators must combine color coding with text labels for accessibility.

**Collaboration features** enable secure internal messaging with @mentions, shared case notes with revision history, and role-based access controls. Audit trails must track all actions for accountability.

## Technical architecture must support scale and security

### Multi-tenancy demands careful isolation strategy

PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS) emerges as the recommended approach:

```sql
ALTER TABLE incidents ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON incidents 
  USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant')::uuid);
```

This provides resource efficiency while maintaining security boundaries. Combined with tenant-aware connection pooling and compound indexes, this architecture scales to thousands of communities.

### Authentication requires multiple strategies

Modern auth patterns must support diverse user needs:

**JWT with refresh tokens** provides stateless authentication with 15-minute access tokens and 7-day refresh tokens. Tenant context embeds directly in tokens for efficient authorization.

**Social login integration** via Passport.js reduces friction for reporters while maintaining security. Google, GitHub, and other providers map to tenant-specific user records.

**Magic links** offer password-free authentication ideal for one-time reporters. Time-limited tokens (15 minutes) with single-use enforcement prevent replay attacks.

### Security must be comprehensive and proactive

Multiple security layers protect sensitive incident data:

**File upload validation** combines MIME type checking, file size limits (10MB), and virus scanning via ClamAV integration. Encrypted storage in S3 with signed URLs provides secure access control.

**Audit logging** captures every system action with user, timestamp, and change details. Append-only storage prevents tampering while enabling compliance reporting.

**Rate limiting** prevents abuse with differentiated limits: 5 auth attempts per 15 minutes, 100 API requests per 15 minutes, 10 file uploads per hour. Redis-backed storage enables distributed enforcement.

### Infrastructure must support both SaaS and self-hosted deployment

Docker/Kubernetes configurations enable flexible deployment:

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "256Mi"
    cpu: "250m"
  limits:
    memory: "512Mi"
    cpu: "500m"
```

CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions automate testing and deployment. Prometheus metrics track system health, while structured logging enables debugging and compliance auditing.

## Community context reveals critical success factors

### Conference incident management requires rapid response

Real-world data from major conferences informs system design:

**Incident frequency** averages 4-12 reports per 20,000-attendee event. Most involve inappropriate comments or policy violations, with serious harassment less common but requiring immediate response.

**Response team structure** typically includes 3-5 trained volunteers with clear identification. Pre-event training has become standard, with role-playing exercises preparing teams for actual incidents.

**Multi-channel coordination** spans physical venue security, online platform moderators, and post-event social media. Systems must support this cross-platform complexity while maintaining unified incident records.

### Open source projects need asynchronous workflows

Distributed communities face unique challenges:

**Email-centric processes** accommodate contributors across time zones. The Kubernetes model guarantees 3-day response times while allowing for thorough consensus building.

**Governance integration** links code of conduct enforcement with technical decision-making. Clear separation prevents conflicts of interest while maintaining community coherence.

**Long-term patterns** matter more than individual incidents. Projects need to track contributor behavior across years, identifying coaching opportunities before problems escalate.

### Online communities demand real-time moderation support

Platform-specific requirements shape system needs:

**Tiered moderation** structures create clear escalation paths from community volunteers to platform staff. Each level needs appropriate tools and permissions within the system.

**Cross-platform coordination** becomes critical as bad actors migrate between Discord, Slack, and forums. Unified tracking helps communities share safety information while respecting privacy.

**Community health metrics** extend beyond individual cases. Response time, resolution rate, and recidivism tracking help communities improve their processes over time.
