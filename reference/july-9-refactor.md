### 🔶 FRONTEND LOGGING SYSTEM (Phase 2)

**Issue**: Frontend contains 110 console statements across 45 files
**Impact**: Client-side debug information exposure, poor production logging
**Scope**: 
- Page components with extensive console.error for error handling
- Debug console.log statements in user interactions
- Migration scripts with console output (should be cleaned up)

**Frontend Logging Requirements:**
1. **Client-side logging framework** for browser environments
2. **Error tracking and reporting** for production debugging  
3. **User interaction analytics** for UX improvement
4. **Security**: No sensitive data in client logs
5. **Performance**: Minimal impact on bundle size and runtime

**Recommended Approach:**
- **Development**: Structured console logging with log levels
- **Production**: Error tracking service integration (Sentry, LogRocket, etc.)
- **Analytics**: User behavior tracking for incident reporting flows
- **Bundle optimization**: Tree-shakeable logging in production builds

**Files with highest console statement count:**
- Pages with complex user interactions (team management, incident reporting)
- Authentication and registration flows  
- Organization and event management pages
- Error handling throughout the application

**Action Plan:**
1. Implement client-side logging framework (Phase 2)
2. Add error boundary logging and reporting
3. Replace console.error with proper error tracking
4. Add user interaction logging for UX insights
5. Remove debug console.log statements from production builds
6. Create development vs production logging strategies

**Integration with Backend Logging:**
- Correlate client-side errors with server-side logs
- Track full user journey from frontend to backend
- Implement request correlation IDs across frontend/backend

**Why Frontend Logging is Different from Backend:**

**Backend Logging (✅ Completed):**
- Server-side Winston logger with file outputs
- Structured logging with JSON format
- Log levels for different environments
- Morgan for HTTP request logging
- Centralized logging on server infrastructure

**Frontend Logging (📋 Planned for Phase 2):**
- Browser-based logging with different constraints
- Cannot write to server file system directly
- Must consider bundle size and performance impact
- Client-side error tracking and user experience monitoring
- Integration with error reporting services
- User privacy and data sensitivity considerations

**Frontend-Specific Challenges:**
1. **Bundle Size**: Logging libraries increase JavaScript bundle size
2. **Privacy**: Must not log sensitive user data (passwords, tokens, PII)
3. **Performance**: Logging should not impact user experience
4. **Error Tracking**: Need to capture and report client-side errors for debugging
5. **User Analytics**: Track user interactions for UX improvements while respecting privacy

**Frontend Logging Strategy:**
- **Development**: Rich console logging for debugging
- **Production**: Minimal logging, focus on error tracking
- **Error Reporting**: Integration with services like Sentry for production error monitoring
- **Analytics**: User behavior tracking for incident reporting flow optimization
