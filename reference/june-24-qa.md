# June 2024 QA Issue Tracking

## Authentication & Access Control Issues

### âœ… COMPLETED: Unauthenticated Page Access
- **Issue**: Pages requiring login should show "you must be logged in" message with login link/embed
- **Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**
- **Priority**: High
- **Affected Pages**: Multiple
- **Analysis**: 
  - Some pages (like `/events/[eventSlug]/dashboard.tsx`) show login prompts but inconsistently
  - Admin pages (`/admin/events/index.tsx`) don't check authentication at all
  - Profile pages (`/profile/settings.tsx`) don't show login prompts for unauthenticated users
  - No consistent authentication pattern across pages
- **Solution**: Created consistent authentication HOC/hook and applied it to all protected pages
- **Implementation**:
  - âœ… Created `useAuthGuard` hook with consistent authentication/authorization logic
  - âœ… Created `AuthGuard` component that shows proper login prompts and handles redirects
  - âœ… Applied `AuthGuard` to `/admin/events/index.tsx` with `system_admin` role requirement
  - âœ… Applied `AuthGuard` to `/profile/settings.tsx` for general authentication
  - âœ… All frontend tests passing (78/78 - 100% success rate)
- **Files Modified**:
  - `frontend/hooks/useAuthGuard.ts` (new)
  - `frontend/components/shared/AuthGuard.tsx` (new)
  - `frontend/pages/admin/events/index.tsx`
  - `frontend/pages/profile/settings.tsx`

### âœ… COMPLETED: PDF Export Corruption
- **Issue**: PDF export generates files that cannot be opened (corrupted format)
- **Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Root Cause**: Backend was generating plain text files with `.txt` extension but frontend was labeling them as `.pdf` files, causing corruption when users tried to open them as PDFs
- **Solution**: 
  - **Frontend Fix**: Implemented proper PDF generation using `jsPDF` library for client-side PDF creation
  - **Enhanced Features**: Added proper PDF formatting with titles, headers, pagination, text wrapping, and professional layout
  - **Maintained CSV**: Kept backend CSV export functionality working as-is for consistent behavior
- **Implementation**:
  - âœ… Added `jsPDF` dependency to frontend
  - âœ… Updated `EnhancedReportList.tsx` to generate real PDF files client-side
  - âœ… Added proper PDF formatting with titles, metadata, pagination and text wrapping
  - âœ… Maintained existing CSV export functionality through backend
  - âœ… All 78 frontend tests passing + All 274 backend tests passing
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `frontend/components/reports/EnhancedReportList.tsx` - Added jsPDF-based PDF generation
  - `frontend/package.json` - Added jsPDF dependency

### âœ… FIXED: Invite System RBAC Inconsistency  
- **Issue**: Invite creation used legacy Role table but redemption expected unified roles
- **Status**: FIXED âœ…
- **Fix Details**: Updated EventInviteLink schema to use UnifiedRole, created migration, updated InviteService
- **Commit**: b4b6daa, 345d185

## Global Dashboard Issues (/dashboard)

### âœ… RESOLVED: Header Statistics 
- **Issue**: Header stats may not be using real data (events count, reports count, needs response)
- **Status**: âœ… **RESOLVED** (False Positive)
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Investigation**: Thoroughly reviewed all dashboard statistics components and found they ARE using real data:
  - **QuickStats**: `/api/users/me/quickstats` endpoint provides real user event/report counts
  - **EventStats**: `/api/events/slug/:slug/stats` endpoint calculates actual event statistics 
  - **AdminStats**: `/api/admin/events/stats` endpoint provides system-wide real statistics
  - **Implementation**: All components properly fetch from backend services using unified RBAC data
- **Resolution**: No action needed - statistics are correctly implemented and use real database data
