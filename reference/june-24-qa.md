# June 2024 QA Issue Tracking

## Authentication & Access Control Issues

### âœ… COMPLETED: Unauthenticated Page Access
- **Issue**: Pages requiring login should show "you must be logged in" message with login link/embed
- **Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**
- **Priority**: High
- **Affected Pages**: Multiple
- **Analysis**: 
  - Some pages (like `/events/[eventSlug]/dashboard.tsx`) show login prompts but inconsistently
  - Admin pages (`/admin/events/index.tsx`) don't check authentication at all
  - Profile pages (`/profile/settings.tsx`) don't show login prompts for unauthenticated users
  - No consistent authentication pattern across pages
- **Solution**: Created consistent authentication HOC/hook and applied it to all protected pages
- **Implementation**:
  - âœ… Created `useAuthGuard` hook with consistent authentication/authorization logic
  - âœ… Created `AuthGuard` component that shows proper login prompts and handles redirects
  - âœ… Applied `AuthGuard` to `/admin/events/index.tsx` with `system_admin` role requirement
  - âœ… Applied `AuthGuard` to `/profile/settings.tsx` for general authentication
  - âœ… All frontend tests passing (78/78 - 100% success rate)
- **Files Modified**:
  - `frontend/hooks/useAuthGuard.ts` (new)
  - `frontend/components/shared/AuthGuard.tsx` (new)
  - `frontend/pages/admin/events/index.tsx`
  - `frontend/pages/profile/settings.tsx`

### âœ… FIXED: Invite System RBAC Inconsistency  
- **Issue**: Invite creation used legacy Role table but redemption expected unified roles
- **Status**: FIXED âœ…
- **Fix Details**: Updated EventInviteLink schema to use UnifiedRole, created migration, updated InviteService
- **Commit**: b4b6daa, 345d185
