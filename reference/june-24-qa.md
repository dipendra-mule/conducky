# June 2024 QA Issue Tracking

## Authentication & Access Control Issues

### âœ… COMPLETED: Unauthenticated Page Access
- **Issue**: Pages requiring login should show "you must be logged in" message with login link/embed
- **Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**
- **Priority**: High
- **Affected Pages**: Multiple
- **Analysis**: 
  - Some pages (like `/events/[eventSlug]/dashboard.tsx`) show login prompts but inconsistently
  - Admin pages (`/admin/events/index.tsx`) don't check authentication at all
  - Profile pages (`/profile/settings.tsx`) don't show login prompts for unauthenticated users
  - No consistent authentication pattern across pages
- **Solution**: Created consistent authentication HOC/hook and applied it to all protected pages
- **Implementation**:
  - âœ… Created `useAuthGuard` hook with consistent authentication/authorization logic
  - âœ… Created `AuthGuard` component that shows proper login prompts and handles redirects
  - âœ… Applied `AuthGuard` to `/admin/events/index.tsx` with `system_admin` role requirement
  - âœ… Applied `AuthGuard` to `/profile/settings.tsx` for general authentication
  - âœ… All frontend tests passing (78/78 - 100% success rate)
- **Files Modified**:
  - `frontend/hooks/useAuthGuard.ts` (new)
  - `frontend/components/shared/AuthGuard.tsx` (new)
  - `frontend/pages/admin/events/index.tsx`
  - `frontend/pages/profile/settings.tsx`

### âœ… COMPLETED: PDF Export Corruption
- **Issue**: PDF export generates files that cannot be opened (corrupted format)
- **Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Root Cause**: Backend was generating plain text files with `.txt` extension but frontend was labeling them as `.pdf` files, causing corruption when users tried to open them as PDFs
- **Solution**: 
  - **Frontend Fix**: Implemented proper PDF generation using `jsPDF` library for client-side PDF creation
  - **Enhanced Features**: Added proper PDF formatting with titles, headers, pagination, text wrapping, and professional layout
  - **Maintained CSV**: Kept backend CSV export functionality working as-is for consistent behavior
- **Implementation**:
  - âœ… Added `jsPDF` dependency to frontend
  - âœ… Updated `EnhancedReportList.tsx` to generate real PDF files client-side
  - âœ… Added proper PDF formatting with titles, metadata, pagination and text wrapping
  - âœ… Maintained existing CSV export functionality through backend
  - âœ… All 78 frontend tests passing + All 274 backend tests passing
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `frontend/components/reports/EnhancedReportList.tsx` - Added jsPDF-based PDF generation
  - `frontend/package.json` - Added jsPDF dependency

### âœ… FIXED: Invite System RBAC Inconsistency  
- **Issue**: Invite creation used legacy Role table but redemption expected unified roles
- **Status**: FIXED âœ…
- **Fix Details**: Updated EventInviteLink schema to use UnifiedRole, created migration, updated InviteService
- **Commit**: b4b6daa, 345d185

## Global Dashboard Issues (/dashboard)

### âœ… RESOLVED: Header Statistics 
- **Issue**: Header stats may not be using real data (events count, reports count, needs response)
- **Status**: âœ… **RESOLVED** (False Positive)
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Investigation**: Thoroughly reviewed all dashboard statistics components and found they ARE using real data:
  - **QuickStats**: `/api/users/me/quickstats` endpoint provides real user event/report counts
  - **EventStats**: `/api/events/slug/:slug/stats` endpoint calculates actual event statistics 
  - **AdminStats**: `/api/admin/events/stats` endpoint provides system-wide real statistics
  - **Implementation**: All components properly fetch from backend services using unified RBAC data
- **Resolution**: No action needed - statistics are correctly implemented and use real database data

### âœ… COMPLETED: Recent Activity Placeholder
- **Issue**: Recent Activity section shows placeholder data, not real activity
- **Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Root Cause**: Backend `UserService.getActivity()` method was returning hardcoded mock data instead of querying real audit logs, reports, and comments
- **Solution**: Replaced mock implementation with real data queries
- **Implementation**:
  - âœ… Updated `UserService.getActivity()` to query real audit logs, reports, and comments
  - âœ… Added proper activity filtering by user's event access (using unified RBAC)
  - âœ… Implemented chronological sorting of all activity types (reports, comments, audit logs)
  - âœ… Added meaningful activity messages for different action types
  - âœ… Limited results to top 20 most recent activities for performance
  - âœ… All 274 backend tests passing + All 78 frontend tests passing
- **Files Modified**:
  - `backend/src/services/user.service.ts` - Replaced mock activity with real data implementation
- **Activity Types Now Supported**:
  - Report submissions by user
  - Reports assigned to user
  - Comments posted by user
  - Audit log activities (invites, role changes, status updates)

## Reports Management Issues

### âœ… RESOLVED: CSV Export Missing URL Field
- **Issue**: CSV export missing URL field
- **Status**: âœ… **RESOLVED** (Already Implemented)
- **Priority**: High
- **Investigation**: 
  - Checked backend `/api/events/slug/:slug/reports/export` endpoint
  - Found CSV export already includes URL field in header: `ID,Title,Type,Status,Severity,Reporter,Assigned,Created,Description,URL`
  - Each report row includes full URL: `${req.protocol}://${req.get('host')}/events/${slug}/reports/${report.id}`
  - Test `should export reports as CSV` validates URL field presence and content
  - All backend tests passing (274/274) including CSV export test
- **Resolution**: No action needed - URL field already correctly implemented and tested

### âœ… COMPLETED: Missing Columns for Reporter and Assignee
- **Issue**: Missing columns for reporter and assignee in reports table
- **Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Solution**: Added Reporter column to reports table display
- **Implementation**:
  - âœ… Added Reporter column header to both pinned and regular reports table sections
  - âœ… Added Reporter column data displaying `report.reporter?.name` in both table sections
  - âœ… Updated column count calculation for empty state messages
  - âœ… Assignee column already existed conditionally (when `canViewAssignments` is true)
  - âœ… All 78 frontend tests passing (100% success rate)
- **Files Modified**:
  - `frontend/components/reports/EnhancedReportList.tsx` - Added Reporter column to table headers and data rows
- **Table Columns Now**: Title, Type, Status, Severity, Reporter, Assigned (conditional), Created, Actions

### ðŸ”´ Report Detail Page (/events/.../reports/...)
### âœ… COMPLETED: Field Edits Don't Refresh UI
- **Issue**: Field edits don't refresh UI after save (type, description, incident date, location, parties)
- **Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Root Cause**: Missing `onReportUpdate` callback in report detail page - field edits were calling `onReportUpdate(responseData.report)` but the callback wasn't passed to `ReportDetailView` component
- **Solution**: Added missing `onReportUpdate` callback that updates the report state when field edits are saved
- **Implementation**:
  - âœ… Added `onReportUpdate` prop to `ReportDetailView` component in `/pages/events/[eventSlug]/reports/[reportId]/index.tsx`
  - âœ… Connected callback to `setReport(updatedReport)` to update parent state with new field values
  - âœ… All field edit handlers (location, description, type, incident date, parties, contact preference) now properly refresh UI
  - âœ… All 78 frontend tests passing (100% success rate)
- **Fields Now Working**: Type, Description, Incident Date, Location, Parties Involved, Contact Preference
- **User Experience**: Field edits now immediately show updated values without requiring page refresh

- **Issue 2**: Markdown comments not rendered as markdown
- **Status**: Not started
- **Priority**: Medium

### ðŸ”´ New Report Creation (/events/.../reports/new)
- **Issue**: Allows submitting reports with future dates
- **Status**: Not started
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Fix**: Add validation to prevent future incident dates

- **Status**: Not started
- **Priority**: Low

- **Issue 2**: Logo upload doesn't refresh UI after upload
- **Status**: Not started
- **Priority**: Medium

- **Issue 3**: User list should be removed (redundant with team page)
- **Status**: Not started
- **Priority**: Low

### ðŸ”´ Team Management Issues

#### View User Page (/events/.../team/...)
- **Issue**: Missing event context - should show which event user belongs to
- **Status**: Not started
- **Priority**: Low

#### Event Team Page (/events/.../team)
- **Issue**: User list needs context menu (View, User's Reports, Change Role, Remove)
- **Status**: Not started
- **Priority**: Medium

#### âœ… LIKELY FIXED: Invite Users Page (/events/.../team/invite)
- **Issue**: Creating invite throws 400 Bad Request error
- **Status**: âœ… **LIKELY FIXED** (via invite system RBAC fix)
- **Priority**: High
- **Root Cause Analysis**: 
  - The invite system was using legacy `Role` table for creation but unified roles for redemption
  - This caused foreign key constraint issues and 400 errors during invite creation
- **Fix Applied**: Complete migration to unified RBAC system
  - Updated `EventInviteLink` schema to reference `UnifiedRole` instead of legacy `Role`
  - Updated backend invite routes to use unified role IDs correctly
  - Created proper database migration for production environments
- **Testing**: All backend tests (274/274) and frontend tests (78/78) passing
- **Verification Needed**: Manual testing to confirm invite creation now works properly
