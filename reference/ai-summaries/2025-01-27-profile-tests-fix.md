# AI Session Summary - Profile Tests Authentication Fix
**Date**: January 27, 2025  
**Branch**: `user-profile-170-171`  
**Session Focus**: Fixing profile test authentication and Prisma mocking issues

## Session Context
Started with 17 failing tests out of 23 in the profile test suite due to authentication mocking conflicts and missing Prisma mock methods.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Authentication Mocking Conflicts
**Problem**: Profile tests were trying to override existing test authentication middleware with conflicting mocks
**Root Cause**: `backend/index.js` already had test authentication middleware that sets:
```javascript
req.isAuthenticated = () => true;
req.user = { id: "1", email: "admin@example.com", name: "Admin" };
```

**Solution**: 
- Removed complex authentication mocking from profile tests
- Enhanced existing test middleware to support header-based controls:
  - `x-test-disable-auth: "true"` - disables authentication
  - `x-test-user-id: "2"` - sets specific user ID
- Updated all authentication tests to use header-based approach

### 2. Missing Prisma Mock Methods
**Problem**: Tests failing due to missing mock implementations
**Fixes Applied**:
- Added `findFirst` method to `userEventRole` mock with proper filtering and include support
- Enhanced `eventInviteLink.findUnique` to search by both `id` and `code` fields

### 3. Duplicate Route Definition
**Problem**: Duplicate `/users/me/events/:eventId` DELETE route in `index.js`
**Solution**: Removed the duplicate route definition

## Test Results
- **Before**: 17 failures out of 23 profile tests
- **After**: All 133 backend tests passing (including 23 profile tests)
- **Frontend**: All 36 tests passing

## Key Technical Improvements

### Enhanced Test Authentication Middleware
```javascript
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === "test") {
  app.use((req, res, next) => {
    // Check for auth disable header
    if (req.headers["x-test-disable-auth"] === "true") {
      req.isAuthenticated = () => false;
      req.user = null;
      return next();
    }
    
    // Default or custom user
    const userId = req.headers["x-test-user-id"] || "1";
    req.isAuthenticated = () => true;
    req.user = { 
      id: userId, 
      email: userId === "1" ? "admin@example.com" : `user${userId}@example.com`, 
      name: userId === "1" ? "Admin" : `User ${userId}` 
    };
    next();
  });
}
```

### Improved Prisma Mocks
- Added comprehensive `userEventRole.findFirst` with filtering support
- Enhanced `eventInviteLink.findUnique` with multi-field search capability
- Maintained consistency with existing mock patterns

## Files Modified
- `backend/index.js` - Enhanced test auth middleware, removed duplicate route
- `backend/__mocks__/@prisma/client.js` - Added missing mock methods
- `backend/tests/integration/profile.test.js` - Simplified authentication approach
- `frontend/pages/profile/settings.tsx` - Minor formatting
- `frontend/pages/profile/events.tsx` - Minor formatting

## Testing Strategy Lessons
1. **Leverage Existing Infrastructure**: Use existing test middleware rather than creating conflicting mocks
2. **Header-Based Control**: Provides flexible test scenarios without complex setup
3. **Comprehensive Mock Coverage**: Ensure all Prisma methods used in tests have proper mocks
4. **Authentication Edge Cases**: Test both authenticated and unauthenticated scenarios

## Current Status
- All profile functionality (Issues #170 and #171) fully implemented and tested
- Comprehensive test coverage with 23 profile-specific tests
- Ready for PR creation and review
- No outstanding test failures or authentication issues

## Next Steps
- Create Pull Request for Issues #170 and #171
- Update documentation for profile features
- Consider adding integration tests for profile workflows
