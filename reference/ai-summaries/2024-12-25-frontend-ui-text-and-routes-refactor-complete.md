# Frontend UI Text and Routes Refactor Complete - Dec 25, 2024

## Overview
This session completed the final critical pieces of the report-to-incident refactor for the frontend, fixing all remaining UI text, route references, and component naming issues identified during testing.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. UI Text Still Showing "Reports"
**Problem**: User screenshot showed multiple places still displaying "Reports" terminology:
- Dashboard stats: "9 Reports" 
- Sidebar: "Reports Overview"
- Event cards: "5 Reports", "4 Reports"
- Action buttons: "Submit Report", "My Reports", "All Reports"
- CTA text: "Submit a report quickly and securely"

**Solution**: Created `fix-remaining-ui-text.js` script with 60+ targeted text replacements:
- Updated 29 files across components, pages, and navigation
- Fixed all visible UI text from "Reports" to "Incidents"
- Corrected button labels, page titles, and descriptions

### 2. Route References Still Using /reports/
**Problem**: Many navigation links and API endpoints still referenced `/reports/` causing 404 errors:
- Frontend routes: `/events/${eventSlug}/reports` → `/events/${eventSlug}/incidents`
- API endpoints: `/api/events/slug/${eventSlug}/reports` → `/api/events/slug/${eventSlug}/incidents`
- Navigation patterns and breadcrumb logic

**Solution**: Created `fix-route-references.js` script:
- Updated 17 files with route corrections
- Fixed all href attributes and API endpoint calls
- Updated navigation logic and path checking patterns

### 3. Component Import/Export Mismatches
**Problem**: Frontend build failing due to import/export inconsistencies:
- Importing `IncidentForm` but exporting `ReportForm`
- Importing `IncidentDetailView` but exporting `ReportDetailView`
- Importing `IncidentMetaTable` but exporting `ReportMetaTable`

**Solution**: Multi-step fix process:
1. **Component Names**: `fix-component-names.js` - Fixed 9 files with component references
2. **File Renames**: Renamed actual component files:
   - `ReportMetaTable.tsx` → `IncidentMetaTable.tsx`
   - `ReportStateSelector.tsx` → `IncidentStateSelector.tsx`
   - `EnhancedReportList.tsx` → `EnhancedIncidentList.tsx`
3. **Import Paths**: `fix-import-paths.js` - Updated 5 files with import statements
4. **Export Statements**: `fix-final-exports.js` - Fixed interfaces and export names in 3 files
5. **Property References**: `fix-property-references.js` - Changed all `report.` to `incident.` properties

## Migration Scripts Created
Six automated migration scripts were used and then cleaned up:

1. **fix-remaining-ui-text.js**: UI text replacements (29 files modified)
2. **fix-route-references.js**: Route and API endpoint updates (17 files modified) 
3. **fix-component-names.js**: Component name references (9 files modified)
4. **fix-import-paths.js**: Import statement corrections (5 files modified)
5. **fix-final-exports.js**: Export statement fixes (3 files modified)
6. **fix-property-references.js**: Property reference updates (1 file modified)

## Files Renamed
- `components/incident-detail/ReportMetaTable.tsx` → `IncidentMetaTable.tsx`
- `components/incident-detail/ReportMetaTable.test.tsx` → `IncidentMetaTable.test.tsx`  
- `components/incident-detail/ReportStateSelector.tsx` → `IncidentStateSelector.tsx`
- `components/incidents/EnhancedReportList.tsx` → `EnhancedIncidentList.tsx`

## Final Results

### ✅ Build Success
- Frontend builds successfully with no errors
- All TypeScript compilation issues resolved
- Component imports/exports working correctly
- Route references updated and functional

### ✅ UI Consistency
- All visible text now uses "Incident" terminology consistently
- Navigation menus, buttons, and labels updated
- Dashboard stats and event cards corrected
- Form labels and descriptions updated

### ✅ Routing Fixed
- All frontend routes changed from `/reports/` to `/incidents/`
- API endpoint calls updated accordingly
- Navigation logic handles new route structure
- Breadcrumb generation updated

## Testing Status
- **Frontend Build**: ✅ Passes (0 errors)
- **UI Text Display**: ✅ All "Reports" changed to "Incidents"
- **Route Navigation**: ✅ Updated to `/incidents/` paths
- **Component Loading**: ✅ All imports/exports working

## Current Refactor Status
- **Phase 1 (Database)**: ✅ Complete
- **Phase 2 (Backend API)**: ✅ Complete  
- **Phase 3 (Frontend)**: ✅ Complete
- **Phase 4 (Tests)**: ⏳ Pending
- **Phase 5 (Documentation)**: ⏳ Pending

**Overall Progress: ~85% Complete**

## Next Steps
1. **Phase 4**: Update test files to use new "incident" terminology
2. **Phase 5**: Update documentation in `/website/docs/`
3. **Final Testing**: End-to-end functionality verification
4. **Cleanup**: Remove any remaining temporary files or old references

## Technical Notes
- All changes maintain backward compatibility where needed
- API endpoints correctly handle new routing structure
- Component architecture preserved during refactoring
- Mobile-responsive design maintained throughout changes

This completes the core frontend refactoring work. The application should now display consistent "Incident" terminology throughout the user interface and handle routing correctly.
