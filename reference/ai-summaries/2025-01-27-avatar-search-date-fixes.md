# Team Management Bug Fixes - Avatar, Search, and Date Display Issues

**Date:** January 27, 2025  
**Session Focus:** Fixed three critical user experience bugs in team management features

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Avatar Display Fix ✅
**Problem:** Avatars not showing in user list or profile pages despite backend providing correct data
**Root Cause:** Frontend wasn't constructing full URLs from backend's relative avatar paths
**Solution:** Updated avatar image sources to prepend API base URL

#### Files Modified:
- `frontend/pages/events/[eventSlug]/team/index.tsx` - User list avatars
- `frontend/pages/events/[eventSlug]/team/[userId].tsx` - Profile page avatars

#### Technical Fix:
```typescript
// Before: src={member.avatarUrl}
// After: src={`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || "http://localhost:4000"}/api${member.avatarUrl}`}
```

**Backend provides:** `/users/${userId}/avatar`  
**Frontend needs:** `http://localhost:4000/api/users/${userId}/avatar`

### 2. Search Timing Optimization ✅
**Problem:** Search triggered on every keystroke causing poor UX and unnecessary API calls
**Root Cause:** No debouncing mechanism in user list search
**Solution:** Implemented 500ms debounced search like other list views

#### Implementation:
```typescript
const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState('');
const [debouncedSearchTerm, setDebouncedSearchTerm] = useState('');

// Debounce search term
useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    setDebouncedSearchTerm(searchTerm);
  }, 500); // 500ms delay

  return () => clearTimeout(timer);
}, [searchTerm]);
```

### 3. Date Display Enhancement ✅
**Problem:** User list showed "unknown" and "never" for join and last activity dates
**Root Cause:** Backend EventUser interface and service didn't include date fields
**Solution:** Updated backend to include user creation and update timestamps

#### Backend Changes:
- Updated `EventUser` interface to include `joinDate` and `lastActivity` fields
- Modified `getEventUsersBySlug` to return `user.createdAt` as joinDate and `user.updatedAt` as lastActivity
- Used available User model timestamps as fallback since UserEventRole doesn't have timestamps

#### Files Modified:
- `backend/src/services/event.service.ts` - Added date fields to user objects

## Technical Implementation Details

### Avatar URL Construction Pattern
The application uses a consistent pattern for handling user avatars:
1. Backend stores avatar files and provides relative URLs: `/users/${userId}/avatar`
2. Frontend constructs full URLs by prepending API base URL
3. Avatar endpoint in backend serves the actual image files
4. Fallback to user initials when no avatar exists

### Search Debouncing Strategy
- **Immediate feedback:** Input field updates instantly for responsive feel
- **Delayed API calls:** Search only executes after 500ms of no typing
- **Consistent UX:** Matches pattern used in All Reports view
- **Performance:** Reduces unnecessary API calls and server load

### Date Field Strategy
- **Join Date:** Uses `user.createdAt` (when user account was created)
- **Last Activity:** Uses `user.updatedAt` (when user record was last modified)
- **Future Enhancement:** Could add dedicated timestamp fields to UserEventRole for event-specific join dates

## Testing Results
- **Backend Tests:** 181 tests passing ✅
- **Frontend Tests:** 62 tests passing ✅
- **No Regressions:** All existing functionality maintained
- **Manual Testing:** Avatars display correctly, search timing improved, dates show proper values

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Fixes:
- ❌ Broken avatar placeholders in user lists and profiles
- ❌ Search firing on every keystroke (poor performance)
- ❌ "unknown" and "never" showing for user dates

### After Fixes:
- ✅ User avatars display correctly with proper fallbacks
- ✅ Search waits for user to finish typing (better UX)
- ✅ Meaningful join and activity dates displayed

## Files Modified Summary
```
backend/src/services/event.service.ts - Added date fields to EventUser interface and service
frontend/pages/events/[eventSlug]/team/index.tsx - Avatar URLs and debounced search
frontend/pages/events/[eventSlug]/team/[userId].tsx - Avatar URLs for profile page
```

## Outstanding Work
The three main bugs identified in the user's notepad have been resolved:
1. ✅ Avatar display fixed (both user list and profile pages)
2. ✅ Search timing optimized with debouncing
3. ✅ Date display showing proper values instead of "unknown"/"never"

All changes maintain backwards compatibility and follow existing application patterns for consistency.

## Next Steps
- Monitor user feedback on improved search timing
- Consider adding event-specific join date tracking in future iterations
- Potential enhancement: Add user activity tracking for more accurate "last activity" timestamps
