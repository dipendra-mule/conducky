# Organizations Feature Phase 2 Implementation Complete

**Date**: December 21, 2024  
**Branch**: `feature/organizations-implementation`  
**Session Focus**: Complete Phase 2 Core UI & Navigation + Event Creation Wiring

## Session Summary

Successfully completed Phase 2 of the Organizations Feature implementation, delivering a fully functional organization management system with complete event creation capabilities.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Complete Frontend Implementation (4 Organization Pages)
- **Organization Dashboard** (`/orgs/[orgSlug]/`) - Overview with metrics, events, activity feed
- **Events Management** (`/orgs/[orgSlug]/events/`) - Full events listing with search/filtering
- **Team Management** (`/orgs/[orgSlug]/team/`) - Member management with role-based access
- **Organization Settings** (`/orgs/[orgSlug]/settings/`) - Profile and configuration management

### 2. Navigation Hierarchy Integration
- **Three-tier navigation**: Global â†’ Organization â†’ Event
- **Organization context switcher** in sidebar with role badges
- **Role-based navigation filtering** (org_admin vs org_viewer permissions)
- **Organization data integration** in _app.tsx with proper state management

### 3. Event Creation Workflow (Full Backend + Frontend Integration)
- **Backend API endpoints**: 
  - `POST /api/organizations/:id/events` - Create events within organizations
  - `GET /api/organizations/:id/events` - List organization events
- **Frontend form integration**: Fully wired event creation with validation
- **Authentication & authorization**: org_admin required, auto-assignment as event admin
- **Error handling**: Duplicate slug prevention, comprehensive validation
- **Real-time data**: Replaced all mock data with live API integration

### 4. Issue Resolution & Debugging
- **Mock data replacement**: Fixed organization dashboard and events pages to use real API
- **Route ordering fix**: Resolved backend route conflicts for organization slug endpoints
- **Container restart**: Properly reloaded backend to pick up new API routes
- **Data verification**: Confirmed event creation working with proper organizationId linking

### Frontend Changes
- `frontend/pages/orgs/[orgSlug]/index.tsx` - Organization dashboard with real API integration
- `frontend/pages/orgs/[orgSlug]/events/index.tsx` - Events management with real data
- `frontend/pages/orgs/[orgSlug]/events/new.tsx` - Event creation form wired to backend
- `frontend/pages/orgs/[orgSlug]/team/index.tsx` - Team management interface
- `frontend/pages/orgs/[orgSlug]/settings/index.tsx` - Organization settings page
- `frontend/components/nav-organizations.tsx` - Organization navigation component
