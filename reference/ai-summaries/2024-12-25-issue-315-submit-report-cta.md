## Implementation Summary

### Key Changes Made

#### 1. Dashboard Component (`frontend/pages/dashboard/index.tsx`)
- Added prominent Submit Report CTA section positioned after header
- Implemented smart logic for single vs multiple events:
  - **Single Event**: Direct button linking to `/events/{slug}/reports/new`

- Used gradient card styling with alert triangle icon for visual prominence
- Fixed `asChild` prop issue with Button component for proper React rendering
- Maintained mobile-first responsive design

#### 2. Test Coverage (`frontend/__tests__/pages/dashboard.test.tsx`)
- Created comprehensive test suite covering:
  - Single event user flow and navigation
  - Multiple event user dropdown selection
  - Loading states and error handling
  - Authentication redirect behavior
  - No events state display
  - CTA positioning verification

### Technical Highlights

#### Mobile-First Design

- Flexible layout for dropdown (`flex-col sm:flex-row`)
- Touch-friendly button sizes
- Proper spacing and typography scaling

#### User Experience
- Clear visual hierarchy with gradient background
- Alert triangle icon conveys urgency appropriately
- Event role indicators in dropdown for context
- Loading states prevent user confusion
- Proper error handling and fallbacks

#### Code Quality
