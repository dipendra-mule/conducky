# Password Reset Implementation - December 28, 2024

## Session Summary

Successfully completed the implementation of Issue #163 (Password Reset functionality) for the Conducky incident management system. This builds upon the previously completed Issue #164 (User Registration) to provide a complete authentication flow.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Email System Infrastructure
- **Added nodemailer dependency** to `backend/package.json`
- **Created comprehensive email service** (`backend/utils/email.js`):
  - Support for multiple providers (SMTP, SendGrid, console logging)
  - Template system for different email types
  - Environment-based configuration
  - Proper error handling and logging
- **Updated environment configuration** (`.env.example`) with email settings
- **Added database model** for password reset tokens with proper relations

### 2. Database Schema Updates
- **Added `PasswordResetToken` model** to Prisma schema:
  - User relation with cascade delete
  - Unique token generation
  - Expiration timestamp
  - Usage tracking (used boolean)
- **Generated and applied migration** using Docker Compose

### 3. Backend API Implementation
- **`POST /auth/forgot-password`** endpoint:
  - Email validation and user lookup
  - Secure token generation (32-byte random hex)
  - 1-hour expiration time
  - Email sending with proper error handling
  - Protection against email enumeration attacks
- **`POST /auth/reset-password`** endpoint:
  - Token validation and expiration checking
  - Strong password requirements enforcement
  - Atomic password update using database transactions
  - One-time token usage enforcement
  - Comprehensive error handling

### 4. Frontend Implementation
- **Enhanced `/forgot-password` page**:
  - Clean, mobile-first form design
  - Email validation with proper error states
  - Success/error message handling
  - Loading states during submission
- **Complete `/reset-password` page**:
  - Token extraction from URL parameters
  - Password strength indicator with real-time validation
  - Password confirmation matching
  - Show/hide password toggles
  - Comprehensive error handling for invalid/expired tokens
  - Success state with redirect to login
- **Updated login page** with "Forgot Password" link

### 5. Security Features Implemented
- **Strong password requirements**: 8+ characters, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters
- **Token security**: 32-byte random tokens with 1-hour expiration
- **One-time use**: Tokens are marked as used after successful reset
- **Email enumeration protection**: Consistent responses regardless of email existence
- **Input sanitization**: Proper validation on both client and server
- **Database transactions**: Atomic operations for password updates

### 6. Comprehensive Testing
- **Created extensive test suite** (`backend/tests/integration/password-reset.test.js`):
  - 14 comprehensive tests covering all scenarios
  - Forgot password flow testing
  - Reset password flow testing
  - Error condition handling
  - Security validation
- **Enhanced Prisma mock** to support:
  - `passwordResetTokens` CRUD operations
  - `$transaction` method with both callback and array patterns
  - Proper data isolation between tests
- **All tests passing**: 102 backend tests + 36 frontend tests

## Technical Implementation Details

### Password Strength Validation
```typescript
const passwordRegex = /^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]{8,}$/;
```

### Token Generation
```javascript
const token = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex');
const expiresAt = new Date(Date.now() + 60 * 60 * 1000); // 1 hour
```

### Database Transaction Pattern
```javascript
await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
  await tx.passwordResetToken.update({
    where: { token },
    data: { used: true }
  });
  await tx.user.update({
    where: { id: resetToken.userId },
    data: { password: hashedPassword }
  });
});
```

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `backend/utils/email.js` - Email service with multi-provider support
- `backend/tests/integration/password-reset.test.js` - Comprehensive test suite
- `frontend/pages/forgot-password.tsx` - Forgot password form page
- `frontend/pages/reset-password.tsx` - Password reset form page

### Modified Files
- `backend/package.json` - Added nodemailer dependency
- `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` - Added PasswordResetToken model
- `backend/index.js` - Added password reset API endpoints
- `backend/__mocks__/@prisma/client.js` - Enhanced mock for testing
- `frontend/pages/login.tsx` - Added forgot password link
- `.env.example` - Added email configuration variables

## Testing Results
- **Backend**: 102 tests passing (including 14 new password reset tests)
- **Frontend**: 36 tests passing
- **Coverage**: All critical paths tested including error conditions
- **Security**: All security requirements validated through tests

## Next Steps
Ready to proceed with Issue #171 (User Profile Settings Page) as outlined in the implementation plan. The authentication foundation is now complete with:
- ✅ User Registration (Issue #164)
- ✅ Password Reset (Issue #163)
- ✅ Email system infrastructure
- ✅ Comprehensive testing

## Key Learnings
1. **Transaction handling**: Proper implementation of database transactions for atomic operations
2. **Mock enhancement**: Complex mock objects require careful state management between tests
3. **Security considerations**: Email enumeration protection and token security are critical
4. **Error handling**: Comprehensive error states improve user experience
5. **Testing patterns**: Isolated test data prevents test interference

This implementation provides a secure, user-friendly password reset flow that integrates seamlessly with the existing authentication system and follows all project security and UX guidelines.
