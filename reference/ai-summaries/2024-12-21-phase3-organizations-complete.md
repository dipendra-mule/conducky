3. **Mock Data Strategy**: Comprehensive mock data made frontend development efficient
4. **Mobile-First Approach**: All interfaces work well on mobile devices

### Challenges Overcome
1. **TypeScript Type Issues**: Resolved authentication type conflicts by using existing middleware
2. **Navigation Integration**: Successfully integrated three-tier navigation hierarchy
3. **Permission Complexity**: Properly implemented role-based access throughout the system

### Future Considerations
1. **Backend API Integration**: All frontend interfaces ready for real API integration
2. **Export Functionality**: Framework in place for CSV/PDF generation
3. **Scalability**: Organization listing designed for pagination and large datasets
