# Conducky Sitemap Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to restructure the frontend pages to match the recommended sitemap from `reference/conducky-sitemap.md`. The goal is to implement a proper three-level navigation pattern: System Level (SuperAdmin), Global Level (User Dashboard), and Event Level (Event Context).

## Current vs. Recommended Structure Analysis

### 🏠 Public/Unauthenticated Pages

#### ✅ Existing & Correct
- `/` - `frontend/pages/index.tsx` (landing page with proper logic)
- `/login` - `frontend/pages/login.tsx` 
- `/invite/[token]` - `frontend/pages/invite/[code].tsx` (accept invite to event)

#### ✅ Created (New Pages)
- [x] `/register` - User registration page (stub created)
- [x] `/forgot-password` - Password reset request page (stub created)

## ✅ Testing Checklist - ALL VERIFIED

After each migration:
- [x] Verify page loads correctly (all pages return HTTP 200)
- [x] Verify navigation links work
- [x] Verify role-based access control still works
- [x] Verify API calls still work with new parameters
- [x] Test mobile responsiveness
- [x] Test dark mode

## ✅ Files That Need Link Updates - ALL COMPLETE

Updated files with navigation links:
- [x] `frontend/pages/_app.tsx` - Updated sidebar and modal links
- [x] `frontend/pages/admin/dashboard.tsx` - Updated event management links
- [x] `frontend/pages/invite/[code].tsx` - Updated post-invite redirect
- [x] `frontend/pages/login.tsx` - Updated post-login redirect
- [x] All event-scoped pages - Updated internal navigation

## ✅ Backend API Considerations - VERIFIED

The backend API endpoints work correctly:
- [x] Route parameter extraction works with new frontend paths
- [x] No hardcoded redirects in backend needed updating
- [x] Session management and authentication flows work correctly

## Navigation Context Best Practices

Based on modern web app patterns, the recommended approach for context-aware navigation is:

### Contextual Sidebar Strategy
- **Different nav items per context**: System Admin, Global Dashboard, Event Context
- **Context switcher**: Clear indicator of current context (breadcrumbs + dropdown)
- **Consistent layout**: Same sidebar position and styling, different content
- **Role-based visibility**: Show/hide nav items based on user permissions

### Context Switching Pattern
```
[System Admin ▼] > Events > Create Event
[Global Dashboard ▼] > My Events
[DevConf 2024 ▼] > Reports > New Report
```

### Implementation Approach
- Sidebar content changes based on current URL path
- Context switcher in header shows current context
- Breadcrumbs show navigation hierarchy
- Mobile: Collapsible sidebar with context-aware content

## ✅ Success Criteria - ALL MET

✅ **Phase 1 Complete When:**
- [x] Global dashboard works at `/dashboard`
- [x] Event dashboard works at `/events/[eventSlug]/dashboard`
- [x] System admin works at `/admin/dashboard`
- [x] All navigation links updated
- [x] No broken links or 404 errors

✅ **Full Implementation Complete When:**
- [x] All pages from sitemap exist (even if stubs)
- [x] Navigation matches three-level pattern
- [x] Role-based access control works correctly
- [x] Mobile responsiveness maintained
- [x] All tests pass

## 🎉 IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: COMPLETE

### ✅ What We've Accomplished
1. **26 new stub pages created** across all navigation contexts
2. **Global dashboard migrated** from index.tsx to dedicated `/dashboard` page
3. **Event pages completely migrated** from `/event/[event-slug]/` to `/events/[eventSlug]/`
4. **System admin migrated** from `/admin.tsx` to `/admin/dashboard.tsx`
5. **All URL parameters updated** from kebab-case to camelCase
6. **All internal links updated** to use new URL structure
7. **Import paths fixed** for all moved files
8. **Old directory structure removed** and cleaned up
9. **All pages tested** and returning HTTP 200

### 🔗 New URL Structure Working
- **System Level**: `/admin/dashboard`, `/admin/events/`, `/admin/system/`
- **Global Level**: `/dashboard`, `/dashboard/reports`, `/profile/`
- **Event Level**: `/events/[eventSlug]/dashboard`, `/events/[eventSlug]/reports/`, `/events/[eventSlug]/settings/`

### 🚀 Ready for Next Steps
The sitemap implementation is now complete! The application has a proper three-level navigation architecture with:
- Clear separation between system admin, global user, and event contexts
- Consistent URL patterns and parameter naming
- All stub pages in place for future feature development
- Maintained functionality while improving structure

## Notes

- **Docker Development**: Remember to use `docker-compose exec frontend npm run dev` for development
- **Database**: No database migrations needed for this frontend restructuring
- **Styling**: Maintained existing dark mode and responsive design patterns
- **Components**: Reused existing UI components (Card, Button, Input, etc.)
- **TypeScript**: Maintained strict TypeScript compliance throughout

This plan provided a comprehensive roadmap for restructuring the frontend to match the recommended sitemap while maintaining all existing functionality. **ALL PHASES ARE NOW COMPLETE!** 🎉
