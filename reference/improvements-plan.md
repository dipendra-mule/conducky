# Conducky Improvements Implementation Plan

## Overview

Based on the comprehensive review in `conducky-complete-review.md`, this plan organizes all recommended improvements into logical groupings for separate PRs. Each section represents a cohesive enhancement that can be developed, tested, and merged independently.

## Implementation Strategy

### Logical Grouping Principles
- **Functional cohesion**: Related features grouped together
- **Page/component focus**: Improvements to specific pages/components
- **Technical alignment**: Similar technical changes combined
- **Testing scope**: Each PR should have clear, focused testing requirements
- **Risk management**: High-impact changes isolated for safer deployment

### Testing Requirements ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Every implementation must include appropriate automated tests:**
- **Unit tests** for new utility functions, hooks, and business logic
- **Integration tests** for new API endpoints and workflows
- **Component tests** for new UI components and interactions
- **Regression tests** to prevent breaking existing functionality
- **Mobile-specific tests** for touch interactions and responsive behavior
- **Accessibility tests** for keyboard navigation and screen reader support

**Testing must be completed before any feature is considered done. Use existing patterns:**
- Backend: Jest with supertest for API testing (`docker-compose exec backend npm test`)
- Frontend: Jest with React Testing Library (`docker-compose exec frontend npm test`)
- Full test suite: `npm run test:all` from project root
- Coverage reports: `npm run test:coverage` (maintain >95% coverage)

**No PR will be merged without:**
- ✅ All existing tests passing
- ✅ New tests covering new functionality
- ✅ Manual testing documentation for complex features
- ✅ Mobile device testing (when applicable)
- ✅ Accessibility compliance verification
