# Organizations Feature Implementation Plan

## Overview
This plan implements organizational support in Conducky, transforming it from event-centric to hierarchical organization management. This is a mandatory migration that will create organizations from existing events and update the role structure.

## Key Implementation Decisions

### Migration Strategy
- **Mandatory Migration**: All existing events will be migrated to organizations
- **Data Preservation**: Create organizations with same name as existing events
- **Role Elevation**: Existing event admins become org admins of their new organizations
- **URL Structure**: Completely migrate to new org-based URLs (`/orgs/[orgSlug]/events/[eventSlug]`)

### Role & Permission Changes
- **SuperAdmin**: Can create orgs, see org admin lists, generate invite links - NO access to org internals
- **Org Admin**: Manage org settings, create events, see aggregated metrics - NO detailed report access unless also event admin
- **Event Admin**: Renamed from "Admin", same event-level permissions
- **Notifications**: Org admins only get notifications if they have appropriate event-level roles

### Data Access Philosophy
- **Aggregated Data Only**: Org admins see metrics/counts, not detailed reports
- **Event-Level Details**: Require event-specific roles (Event Admin, Responder)
- **No RLS**: Skip Row-Level Security for now (future enhancement)

## Database Schema Implementation

### New Tables

```sql
-- Organizations table
CREATE TABLE organizations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  slug VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  website VARCHAR(500),
  logo_url VARCHAR(500),
  settings JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_by UUID REFERENCES users(id)
);

-- Organization memberships
CREATE TABLE organization_memberships (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  organization_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  role organization_role NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  created_by UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  UNIQUE(organization_id, user_id)
);

-- New enum for organization roles
CREATE TYPE organization_role AS ENUM ('org_admin', 'org_viewer');
```

### Modified Tables

```sql
-- Add organization relationship to events (mandatory after migration)
ALTER TABLE events ADD COLUMN organization_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id) NOT NULL;

-- Add organization context to audit logs
ALTER TABLE audit_logs ADD COLUMN organization_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id);

-- Update role enum to rename Admin to Event Admin
-- This will require a careful migration to preserve existing data
```

## Migration Script Strategy

### Step 1: Schema Updates
1. Add new tables and columns
2. Make `organization_id` nullable initially
3. Add new enum values

### Step 2: Data Migration
```javascript
// Pseudo-code for migration logic
for each event in events:
  // Create organization with same name/slug as event
  org = createOrganization({
    name: event.name,
    slug: event.slug + '-org', // Avoid slug conflicts
    description: `Organization for ${event.name}`,
    created_by: firstEventAdmin(event)
  })
  
  // Link event to organization
  updateEvent(event.id, { organization_id: org.id })
  
  // Convert event admins to org admins
  eventAdmins = getEventAdmins(event.id)
  for admin in eventAdmins:
    createOrgMembership(org.id, admin.id, 'org_admin')
```

### Step 3: Schema Finalization
1. Make `organization_id` NOT NULL on events
2. Update role names
3. Remove old constraints

## Frontend Route Structure

### New Routes
```
/orgs                                        # Organizations list (SuperAdmin)
/orgs/new                                    # Create organization (SuperAdmin)
/orgs/[orgSlug]                             # Organization dashboard
/orgs/[orgSlug]/events                      # Organization events management
/orgs/[orgSlug]/events/new                  # Create event in org
/orgs/[orgSlug]/events/[eventSlug]          # Event dashboard (new URL)
/orgs/[orgSlug]/events/[eventSlug]/reports  # Event reports (new URL)
/orgs/[orgSlug]/team                        # Organization team management
/orgs/[orgSlug]/reports                     # Organization reports overview
/orgs/[orgSlug]/settings                    # Organization settings
```

### Deprecated Routes (to be removed)
```
/events/[eventSlug]                         # Old event URLs
/events/[eventSlug]/reports                 # Old report URLs
```

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- [ ] Zero data loss during migration
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved in new URL structure
- [ ] Organization dashboard loads in <500ms
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design across all new interfaces

### User Experience Success
- [ ] Clear organization context in navigation
- [ ] Intuitive organization → event → report hierarchy
- [ ] Smooth migration experience for existing users
- [ ] Comprehensive onboarding for new organization features

### Business Success
- [ ] Enable management of multiple related events
- [ ] Reduce administrative overhead for multi-event organizers
- [ ] Provide aggregated insights for organization oversight
- [ ] Maintain security boundaries between organizations

## Risk Mitigation

### Migration Risks
- **Data Loss**: Comprehensive backup and rollback procedures
- **Downtime**: Staged migration with validation steps
- **URL Breakage**: Implement redirects during transition period

### Development Risks
- **Complexity**: Break down into small, testable increments
- **Scope Creep**: Defer advanced features to future phases
- **Performance**: Implement pagination and caching from start

### User Experience Risks
- **Confusion**: Clear documentation and migration guides
- **Feature Discovery**: Guided onboarding for new organization features
- **Mobile Usability**: Mobile-first design approach

## Implementation Order

1. **Database Schema & Migration** (Phase 1.1-1.3)
2. **Backend API Foundation** (Phase 1.4)
3. **Navigation & Routing** (Phase 2.1)
4. **Organization Dashboard** (Phase 2.2)
5. **Events Management** (Phase 2.3)
6. **Team Management** (Phase 2.4)
7. **Organization Settings** (Phase 2.5)
8. **SuperAdmin Features** (Phase 3.1)
9. **Enhanced Org Features** (Phase 3.2)

This implementation plan prioritizes core functionality while setting up the foundation for future enhancements. The mandatory migration approach ensures all users benefit from the new organizational structure while preserving existing data and workflows.

## Documentation and tests

- All backend/frontend commands and tests should be run using Docker Compose (do not create a new environment).
- Follow project coding, testing, and documentation practices as described in `.cursor/rules/` files.
- Document any new features or changes in `/website/docs` as part of the implementation.
- All new features should be covered by automated tests.
