# Issues 173, 172, 159 Implementation Plan

**Branch:** `issues-173-172-159`  
**Created:** January 27, 2025  
**GitHub Issues:**
- [Issue #173: Implement Event Creation Form](https://github.com/mattstratton/conducky/issues/173)
- [Issue #172: Implement System Admin Events Management Page](https://github.com/mattstratton/conducky/issues/172)  
- [Issue #159: Implement system setting to enable/disable public event listing on home page](https://github.com/mattstratton/conducky/issues/159)

## Overview

This implementation plan focuses on three related features for the SuperAdmin system management interface:

1. **Event Creation Form** - Allow SuperAdmins to create new events with a comprehensive multi-step form
2. **System Admin Events Management** - Display and manage all events with statistics and controls
3. **Public Event Listing Setting** - System setting to control whether unauthenticated users see events on home page

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure ✅
- **Database Schema**: `SystemSetting` model exists with key-value pairs
- **Backend API**: System settings endpoint exists (`/api/system/settings`)
- **Frontend Pages**: Stub pages exist for both admin pages but only show placeholder content
- **Home Page**: Already partially implements public event listing based on system setting

### Missing Components 🔄
- Complete event creation form with validation
- Full system admin events management interface  
- Admin UI to toggle system settings
- Backend endpoints for event creation and management
- Comprehensive validation and error handling

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Backend API Foundation
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours  

1. **System Admin Events API**
   - `GET /api/admin/events` - List all events with statistics
   - `POST /api/admin/events` - Create new event  
   - `PATCH /api/admin/events/:id/status` - Enable/disable events
   - `GET /api/admin/events/stats` - System-wide statistics
   - `GET /api/admin/events/check-slug/:slug` - Check slug availability

2. **System Settings Admin API**
   - `PATCH /api/admin/system/settings` - Update system settings
   - Add SuperAdmin middleware validation

3. **Enhanced Event Creation Logic**
   - Slug auto-generation and validation
   - Initial admin assignment/invitation
   - File upload for event logos

### Phase 2: System Admin Events Management Page
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours

1. **Events Table/Cards Component**
   - Responsive design (table on desktop, cards on mobile)
   - Event statistics display
   - Status indicators (active/disabled)
   - Search and filter functionality

2. **Management Actions**
   - Enable/disable toggle
   - Quick statistics view
   - Create new event button integration

3. **System Statistics Dashboard**
   - Total events, users, reports

   - Activity metrics

### Phase 3: Event Creation Form
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 8-10 hours

1. **Multi-Step Form Wizard**
   - Step 1: Basic Information (name, slug, description)
   - Step 2: Event Details (dates, website, contact)
   - Step 3: Branding (logo upload)
   - Step 4: Initial Admin Setup
   - Step 5: Review and Confirmation

2. **Form Validation & UX**
   - Real-time slug generation from name
   - Slug uniqueness checking
   - Form validation with error display
   - File upload with preview
   - Mobile-responsive design

3. **Initial Admin Assignment**
   - Email validation and user lookup
   - Invitation flow for new users
   - Role assignment automation

### Phase 4: System Settings Admin Interface  
**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours

1. **Settings Management UI**
   - Toggle for public event listing
   - Future-proof for additional system settings
   - Save confirmation and feedback

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Verify home page respects setting changes
   - Test unauthenticated user experience

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Requirements

**Existing Schema** (✅ Already Present):
```prisma
model SystemSetting {
  id    String @id @default(uuid())
  key   String @unique  
  value String
}
```

**Current Seed Data**:
```sql
SystemSetting: { key: "showPublicEventList", value: "false" }
```

### API Endpoints Specification

#### System Admin Events Management
```typescript
// GET /api/admin/events
interface EventsListResponse {
  events: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    slug: string;
    status: 'active' | 'disabled';
    userCount: number;
    reportCount: number;
    createdAt: string;
    updatedAt: string;
    lastActivity?: string;
  }[];
  statistics: {
    totalEvents: number;
    activeEvents: number;
    totalUsers: number;
    totalReports: number;
  };
}

// POST /api/admin/events  
interface CreateEventRequest {
  name: string;
  slug: string;
  description?: string;
  website?: string;
  contactEmail: string;
  startDate?: string;
  endDate?: string;
  codeOfConduct?: string;
  initialAdminEmail: string;
  logo?: File;
}
```

### Frontend Component Architecture

#### System Admin Events Page (`/admin/events/index.tsx`)
```
EventsManagementPage
├── SystemStatsDashboard
├── EventsActionBar (search, filters, create button)
├── EventsTable (desktop)
├── EventsCards (mobile)
└── CreateEventButton
```

#### Event Creation Form (`/admin/events/new.tsx`)  
```
EventCreationPage
├── FormWizardStepper
├── BasicInformationStep
├── EventDetailsStep  
├── BrandingStep
├── AdminSetupStep
├── ReviewStep
└── FormNavigation (back/next/submit)
```

### Security Considerations

1. **SuperAdmin Role Validation**: All endpoints require SuperAdmin role
2. **Input Sanitization**: All form inputs sanitized and validated
3. **File Upload Security**: Logo uploads with type/size validation
4. **CSRF Protection**: Form submissions protected
5. **Rate Limiting**: Event creation rate limits
6. **Audit Logging**: All admin actions logged

### Docker Compose Integration

Since we're working in Docker Compose environment:

```bash
# Database migrations (if needed)
docker-compose exec backend npx prisma migrate dev

# Install new packages
docker-compose exec frontend npm install <package>
docker-compose exec backend npm install <package>  

# Run tests
docker-compose exec backend npm test
docker-compose exec frontend npm test

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f backend
docker-compose logs -f frontend
```
