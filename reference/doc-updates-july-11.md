# Documentation Updates - July 11, 2024

## Summary of Completed Work

### Phase 4: FAQ Breakdown (COMPLETED)
✅ **Broke down faq.md (276 lines) into 7 focused sub-pages:**
- `overview.md` - Main FAQ navigation and popular questions
- `getting-started.md` - New user questions and account setup
- `roles-permissions.md` - User roles and permission explanations
- `incidents-reports.md` - Incident submission and management
- `comments-communication.md` - Comment system and communication
- `events-organizations.md` - Multi-event and organization management
- `technical-integration.md` - Browser support, API, and technical questions
- `account-management.md` - Profile, password, and account settings

### Critical Fixes (COMPLETED)
✅ **Fixed incorrect role progression section** in `understanding-roles.md`:
- Removed misleading "role progression" concept
- Replaced with accurate "role assignment" principles
- Clarified that roles are based on functional needs, not seniority

✅ **Corrected event management flow** in admin guide:
- Updated to reflect proper organizational hierarchy
- System Admin creates organizations → Organization Admin creates events
- Fixed workflow documentation to match actual system behavior

✅ **Resolved API documentation issues**:
- Successfully regenerated auto-generated API docs from swagger.json
- API endpoints now properly available at `/api/` routes
- Sidebar properly structured with Authentication, Events, Reports, Users, and Schemas sections
- All auto-generated endpoints working: login, logout, events, reports, users, schemas

### Issues Identified for Next Phase
⚠️ **Build fails due to broken links** - requires fixing:
- Multiple broken internal links across documentation
- Links to non-existent sub-pages in various sections
- References to old file structures that were reorganized

## User Feedback Addressed

### 1. Role Progression Section (FIXED)
**Issue**: "Role Progression - Many users advance through roles as they gain experience and trust" section was completely wrong
**Resolution**: Removed entire progression concept, replaced with functional role assignment principles

### 2. Event Management Flow (FIXED)  
**Issue**: Documentation incorrectly stated system admins create events directly
**Resolution**: Updated to correct flow - System Admin creates orgs → Org Admin creates events

### 3. API Documentation (FIXED)
**Issue**: Auto-generated API docs were missing despite being configured
**Resolution**: Successfully regenerated API docs using `npm run clean-api-docs conducky` and `npm run gen-api-docs conducky`

## Current Status

### Completed Phases
- ✅ Phase 1: Security Documentation Section (November 2024)
- ✅ Phase 2: Priority User Workflow Documentation (November 2024) 
- ✅ Phase 3: Enhanced Security & Comment Documentation (November 2024)
- ✅ Phase 4: FAQ Breakdown and Critical Fixes (July 2024)

### Next Steps Required
1. **Fix broken links** identified in build process
2. **Complete remaining large file breakdowns** if needed
3. **Test full build** and ensure all navigation works
4. **Update screenshot placeholders** with actual screenshots

## Technical Notes

### API Documentation Resolution
The API documentation issue was resolved by:
1. Running `npm run clean-api-docs conducky` to clear old files
2. Running `npm run gen-api-docs conducky` to regenerate from swagger.json
3. This properly generated all endpoint documentation and schemas
4. The docusaurus-plugin-openapi-docs plugin is working correctly

### Mermaid Diagrams
All Mermaid diagrams are rendering properly after previous configuration fixes:
- `maxTextSize: 100000` prevents size exceeded errors
- `maxEdges: 1000` supports complex diagrams
- Theme configuration working for light/dark modes

### Build Process
The documentation build process includes:
1. API documentation generation from backend swagger.json
2. Mermaid diagram rendering
3. Broken link checking (currently failing)
4. Asset optimization and deployment preparation
