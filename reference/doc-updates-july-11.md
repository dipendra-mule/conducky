# Documentation Updates - July 11, 2024

## Summary of Completed Work

### Phase 4: FAQ Breakdown (COMPLETED)
✅ **Broke down faq.md (276 lines) into 7 focused sub-pages:**
- `overview.md` - Main FAQ navigation and popular questions
- `getting-started.md` - New user questions and account setup
- `roles-permissions.md` - User roles and permission explanations
- `incidents-reports.md` - Incident submission and management
- `comments-communication.md` - Comment system and communication
- `events-organizations.md` - Multi-event and organization management
- `technical-integration.md` - Browser support, API, and technical questions
- `account-management.md` - Profile, password, and account settings

### Critical Fixes (COMPLETED)
✅ **Fixed incorrect role progression section** in `understanding-roles.md`:
- Removed misleading "role progression" concept
- Replaced with accurate "role assignment" principles
- Clarified that roles are based on functional needs, not seniority

✅ **Corrected event management flow** in admin guide:
- Updated to reflect proper organizational hierarchy
- System Admin creates organizations → Organization Admin creates events
- Fixed workflow documentation to match actual system behavior

✅ **Resolved API documentation issues**:
- Successfully regenerated auto-generated API docs from swagger.json
- API endpoints now properly available at `/api/` routes
- Sidebar properly structured with Authentication, Events, Reports, Users, and Schemas sections
- All auto-generated endpoints working: login, logout, events, reports, users, schemas

### Issues Identified for Next Phase
⚠️ **Build fails due to broken links** - requires fixing:
- Multiple broken internal links across documentation
- Links to non-existent sub-pages in various sections
- References to old file structures that were reorganized

## User Feedback Addressed

### 1. Role Progression Section (FIXED)
**Issue**: "Role Progression - Many users advance through roles as they gain experience and trust" section was completely wrong
**Resolution**: Removed entire progression concept, replaced with functional role assignment principles

### 2. Event Management Flow (FIXED)  
**Issue**: Documentation incorrectly stated system admins create events directly
**Resolution**: Updated to correct flow - System Admin creates orgs → Org Admin creates events

### 3. API Documentation (FIXED)
**Issue**: Auto-generated API docs were missing despite being configured
**Resolution**: Successfully regenerated API docs using `npm run clean-api-docs conducky` and `npm run gen-api-docs conducky`

## Current Status

### Completed Phases
- ✅ Phase 1: Security Documentation Section (November 2024)
- ✅ Phase 2: Priority User Workflow Documentation (November 2024) 
- ✅ Phase 3: Enhanced Security & Comment Documentation (November 2024)
- ✅ Phase 4: FAQ Breakdown and Critical Fixes (July 2024)

### Next Steps Required
1. **Fix broken links** identified in build process
2. **Complete remaining large file breakdowns** if needed
3. **Test full build** and ensure all navigation works
4. **Update screenshot placeholders** with actual screenshots

## Technical Notes

### API Documentation Resolution
The API documentation issue was resolved by:
1. Running `npm run clean-api-docs conducky` to clear old files
2. Running `npm run gen-api-docs conducky` to regenerate from swagger.json
3. This properly generated all endpoint documentation and schemas
4. The docusaurus-plugin-openapi-docs plugin is working correctly

### Mermaid Diagrams
All Mermaid diagrams are rendering properly after previous configuration fixes:
- `maxTextSize: 100000` prevents size exceeded errors
- `maxEdges: 1000` supports complex diagrams
- Theme configuration working for light/dark modes

### Build Process
The documentation build process includes:
1. API documentation generation from backend swagger.json
2. Mermaid diagram rendering
3. Broken link checking (currently failing)
4. Asset optimization and deployment preparation

The documentation is now more navigable and accurate, with focused sub-pages that make information easier to find and digest. 

## Swagger Documentation Generation Fix

**Issue:** The `npm run swagger:generate` script in the backend directory was failing because it was trying to use a TypeScript configuration file directly with the `swagger-jsdoc` CLI tool.

**Root Cause:** The CLI tool only accepts `.cjs`, `.json`, `.yml`, or `.yaml` files for configuration, but our configuration was in `src/config/swagger.ts` (TypeScript).

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Created `swagger.config.js`** - A new JavaScript configuration file that exports the OpenAPI specification directly (not wrapped in an options object)
2. **Updated `package.json` script** - Changed from `-d src/config/swagger.ts` to `-d swagger.config.js`
3. **Improved `docs:serve` script** - Replaced the broken `swagger-ui-serve` command with helpful instructions
4. **Added `docs:open` script** - Quick command to open the swagger docs in browser

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/swagger.config.js` (new file)
- `backend/package.json` (updated scripts)

**Current Status:** ✅ **WORKING**
- `npm run swagger:generate` - Generates swagger.json successfully
- `npm run docs:serve` - Shows helpful instructions
- `npm run docs:open` - Opens swagger docs (when server is running)

**How to Use:**
1. Run `npm run swagger:generate` to generate/update the swagger.json
2. Start the backend server with `npm run dev`
3. Visit http://localhost:3001/api-docs to view the interactive documentation
4. Or use `npm run docs:open` to open it directly in your browser

**Note:** The swagger documentation is automatically available when running the backend server in development mode at `/api-docs` endpoint. 

## API Documentation Generation Fix

**Issue:** The `npm run gen-api-docs` script in the website directory was failing with the error "missing required argument 'id'".

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Missing API ID:** The OpenAPI docs plugin was configured with ID `conducky-api` but the script wasn't specifying which API to generate docs for
2. **Missing Organization Schema:** The swagger.json file was missing the `Organization` schema that was referenced by many API endpoints
3. **Broken Links:** The API index page contained links to non-existent endpoints

**Solution Implemented:**

### 1. Fixed Missing Organization Schema
- **Problem:** API routes referenced `#/components/schemas/Organization` but this schema wasn't defined
- **Solution:** Added Organization schema to `backend/swagger.config.js` with all required properties:
  - id, name, slug, description, website, isActive, createdAt, updatedAt
- **Result:** `npm run swagger:generate` now produces complete swagger.json

### 2. Updated Package.json Scripts
- **Before:** `"gen-api-docs": "docusaurus gen-api-docs"`
- **After:** `"gen-api-docs": "docusaurus gen-api-docs conducky"`
- **Also Updated:** `"clean-api-docs": "docusaurus clean-api-docs conducky"`

### 3. Fixed Broken Links in API Index
- **File:** `website/docs/api/index.md`
- **Removed:** Broken links to `/api/user-login`, `/api/get-all-events`, `/api/get-reports`, `/api/get-users`
- **Added:** Working links to actual generated API documentation organized by category

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/swagger.config.js` (added Organization schema)
- `website/package.json` (updated scripts with API ID)
- `website/docs/api/index.md` (fixed broken links)

**Current Status:** ✅ **API GENERATION WORKING**
- `npm run gen-api-docs` successfully generates 28 API endpoint docs + 5 schema docs
- All broken links in API documentation fixed
- **Theme Conflict Issue:** Build still fails due to missing `@theme/Debug*` components (known issue with OpenAPI + Mermaid theme compatibility)

**Generated API Documentation Includes:**
- **Organizations:** 11 endpoints (create, list, get, update, delete, members, invites)
- **Events:** 2 endpoints (create in org, list org events)  
- **Tags:** 6 endpoints (create, update, delete, get, add to incident, remove from incident)
- **Logging:** 1 endpoint (frontend logs)
- **Schemas:** 5 data models (User, Event, Report, Organization, Error)

**How to Use:**
1. **Generate/update API docs:** `cd website && npm run gen-api-docs`
2. **Clean API docs:** `cd website && npm run clean-api-docs`
3. **View locally:** Start dev server and visit `/api` (when theme conflict is resolved)

**Next Steps:**
- Resolve theme compatibility issue between `docusaurus-theme-openapi-docs` and `@docusaurus/theme-mermaid`
- Consider alternative approaches for Mermaid diagram rendering that don't conflict with OpenAPI theme
