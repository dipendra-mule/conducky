## Testing Rules (Cursor)

- All new features must include appropriate automated tests (unit, integration, or both) as part of the implementation.
- Bug fixes should include regression tests to prevent recurrence.
- Tests must be run and pass before a feature or bugfix is considered complete.
- Pull requests should not be merged unless all required tests pass in CI.
- The testing process, including how to run and write tests, must be clearly documented in `/docs/testing.md`.
- When adding or updating features, update `/docs/testing.md` with any new or changed testing instructions as needed.
- Use the provided scripts (`npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`, `npm run test:all`) to run tests locally before pushing changes.
- For features that require manual testing, document the manual test steps in the relevant PR or issue.
