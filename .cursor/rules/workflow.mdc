This rule standardizes the feature branch workflow for collaborative development in this project.

- Always refer to `plan.md` checklist file and make sure to keep it updated. All steps/todos in the `plan.md` should have an associated issue in the `mattstratton/conducky` repository. If the issue doesn't exist, be sure to create it.
- If available, use the GitHub MCP (Multi-Channel Platform) for branch creation, PRs, and related workflow steps to streamline and standardize the process.

Following this workflow helps maintain code quality and project consistency.
