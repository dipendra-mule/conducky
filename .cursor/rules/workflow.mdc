This rule standardizes the feature branch workflow for collaborative development in this project.

- Always refer to `/reference/plan.md` checklist file and make sure to keep it updated. All steps/todos in the `/reference/plan.md` should have an associated issue in the `mattstratton/conducky` repository. If the issue doesn't exist, be sure to create it.
- Issues created that are for features should be tagged as "enhancement", issues created for fixes should be tagged as "bug"
- If available, use the GitHub MCP (Multi-Channel Platform) for branch creation, PRs, and related workflow steps to streamline and standardize the process.
- Always start new work by switching to the `main` branch and running `git pull origin main` to ensure it is up to date.
- Create a new feature branch off of `main` using a clear, descriptive name (e.g., `feature/short-description`).
- If available, use the GitHub MCP (Multi-Channel Platform) for branch creation, PRs, and related workflow steps to streamline and standardize the process.
- Develop and test your feature. Run `npm run test:all` from the root of the project and verify all tests pass before marking the feature as ready.
- When the feature is ready, commit all changes with a descriptive commit message.
- Push your feature branch to the remote repository.
- Open a Pull Request targeting the `main` branch.
- The PR title should be meaningful and easily read, in plain English
- Ensure the PR description is comprehensive, including a summary, testing steps, and any relevant context.
- If the PR fixes an issue (or multiple) including closing keywords in the form of "Fixes #425". Note that if it fixes multiple issues, there should be a new line for each issue like "Fixes #425" and then a new line "Fixes #328", etc.
- If the PR is generated by automation or a bot, append the required bot footer as described in the `github-bot-footer` rule: ðŸ¤– This was generated by a bot. If you have questions, please contact the maintainers.

Following this workflow helps maintain code quality and project consistency.
