This rule is about how you will manage context and things to do in every coding session

- The AI should start every session by running all tests and summarizing failures.
- Always scan recent git diffs/commits for context.

- Generate a persistent summary at the end of each session and add it to a new markdown file (named by timestamp) in /reference/ai-summaries/.
